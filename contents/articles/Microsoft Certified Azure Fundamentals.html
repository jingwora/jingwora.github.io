    <h2>Cloud Concepts</h2>
    <p><a href="#TOP">[TOP]</a></p>

    <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>

    <p>
      Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services—servers, storage,
      databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence and more—over the
      internet (the cloud), enabling faster innovation, flexible resources, and
      economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use,
      helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more
      efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.
      <br />
      The company providing these services is referred to as a cloud provider.
      Some example providers are Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and
      the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Typically, cloud services include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Compute power</b> - such as Linux servers or web applications.</li>
      <li><b>Storage</b> - such as files and databases.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Networking</b> - such as secure connections between the cloud
        provider and your company.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Analytics</b> - such as visualizing telemetry and performance data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Compute power</h3>
    <p>
      Cloud-based servers that are processing each request and returning a
      response.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Virtual machine (VM)</b> - A VM is an emulation of a computer - just
        like your desktop or laptop you're using now. Each VM includes an
        operating system and hardware that appears to the user like a physical
        computer running Windows or Linux. You can then install whatever
        software you need to do the tasks you want to run in the cloud.
      </li>
    </ul>
