    <h2>Cloud Concepts</h2>
    <p><a href="#TOP">[TOP]</a></p>

    <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>

    <p>
      Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services—servers, storage,
      databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence and more—over the
      internet (the cloud), enabling faster innovation, flexible resources, and
      economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use,
      helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more
      efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.
      <br />
      The company providing these services is referred to as a cloud provider.
      Some example providers are Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and
      the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
    </p>

    <h3>Key cloud concepts</h3>
    <p>
      Cloud services have characteristics and considerations, some of which are
      outlined and explained below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>High availability</b> - The ability to keep services up and running
        for long periods of time, with very little downtime.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Scalability</b> - The ability to increase or decrease resources for
        any given workload.
        <br />
        <b>Scaling out</b> - To add additional resources to service a workload
        <br />
        <b>Scaling up</b> - To add additional capabilities to manage an increase
        in demand to the existing resource. A distinction between scalability
        and elasticity is that elasticity is done automatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Elasticity</b> - The ability to automatically or dynamically increase
        or decrease resources as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Agility</b> - The ability to react quickly. Cloud services can
        allocate and deallocate resources quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Fault tolerance</b> - The ability to remain up and running even in
        the event of a component (or service) no longer functioning. Typically,
        redundancy is built into cloud services architecture, so if one
        component fails, a backup component takes its place. This type of
        service is said to be tolerant of faults.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Disaster recovery</b> - The ability to recover from an event which
        has taken down a cloud service. Cloud services disaster recovery can
        happen very quickly, with automation and services being readily
        available to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Global reach</b> - The ability to reach audiences around the globe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Customer latency capabilities</b> - Cloud services have the ability
        to deploy resources in datacenters around the globe, which addresses any
        customer latency issues.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Predictive cost considerations</b> - The ability for users to predict
        the costs they will incur for a particular cloud service.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Technical skill requirements and considerations</b> - Cloud services
        can provide and manage hardware and software for workloads. Getting a
        workload up and running with cloud services demands less technical
        resources than having IT teams build and maintain a physical
        infrastructure for handling the same workload.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Increased productivity</b> - On-site datacenters typically require a
        lot of hardware setup (otherwise known as racking and stacking),
        software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Security</b> Cloud providers offer a broad set of policies,
        technologies, controls, and expert technology skills that can provide
        better security than most organizations can otherwise achieve.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h3>CapEx vs OpEx</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Capital Expenditure (CapEx)</b> - This is the up front spending of
      money on physical infrastructure, and then deducting that up front expense
      over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Operational Expenditure (OpEx)</b> - This is spending money on services
      or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense
      in the same year you spend it. There is no up front cost, as you pay for a
      service or product as you use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, organizations can sign up for a service from a cloud provider to
      get up and running without the need for a significant investment into up
      front costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical on-premises datacenter includes costs such as: Server costs ,
      Storage costs, Network costs, Backup and archive costs, continuity and
      disaster recovery costs, datacenter infrastructure costs, Technical
      personnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Benefits of CapEx</b>
      <br />
      With capital expenditures, you plan your expenses at the start of a
      project or budget period.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Benefits of OpEx</b>
      <br />
      Demand and growth can be unpredictable and can outpace expectation, which
      is a challenge for the CapEx model as shown in the following graph. OpEx
      is particularly appealing if the demand fluctuates or to try a new product
      or service.

      />
    </a>

    <h3>Consumption-based models</h3>
    <p>
      Users only pay for the resources that they use. A consumption-based model
      has many benefits, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>No upfront costs.</li>
      <li>No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure.</li>
      <li>The ability to pay for additional resources when they are needed.</li>
      <li>
        The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h3>Types of cloud models</h3>
    <p>There are three different cloud deployment models.</p>

    <h3>Public cloud</h3>
    <p>
      A public cloud is owned by the cloud services provider. This is the most
      common deployment model. Public cloud models have the following
      characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Ownership</b> - Resources are owned and operated by a third party,
        such as the cloud service provider.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Multiple end users</b> - Public cloud modes may make their resources
        available to multiple organizations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Public access</b> - Public access allows the public to access the
        desired cloud services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Availability</b> - Public cloud is the most common cloud-type
        deployment model.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Connectivity</b> - Users and organizations are typically connected to
        the public cloud over the internet using a web browser.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Skills</b> - Public clouds do not require deep technical knowledge to
        set up and use its resources.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Advantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>No CapEx</li>
      <li>Agility - deprovisioned whenever needed.</li>
      <li>Consumption-based model</li>
      <li>No responsibility for hardware maintenance or updates.</li>
      <li>
        No deep technical skills are required to deploy, use, and gain the
        benefits of a public cloud./li>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Disadvantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Security - There may be specific security requirements.</li>
      <li>
        Compliance - There may be government policies, industry standards, or
        legal requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ownership - Organizations don't own the hardware or services and cannot
        manage them as they may wish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Specific scenarios - If organizations have a unique business requirement
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Private cloud</h3>
    <p>
      A private cloud is owned and operated by the organization that uses the
      resources from that cloud. Private cloud models have the following
      characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Ownership</b> - The owner and user of the cloud services are the
        same.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Hardware</b> - The owner is entirely responsible for the purchase,
        maintenance, and management of the cloud hardware.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Users</b> - A private cloud operates only within one organization and
        cloud computing resources are used exclusively by a single business or
        organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Connectivity</b> - A connection to a private cloud is typically made
        over a private network that is highly secure.
      </li>
      <li><b>Public access</b> - Does not provide access to the public.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Skills</b> - Requires deep technical knowledge to set up, manage, and
        maintain.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A use case scenario for a private cloud are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Legal reasons. For example, they may have medical data that cannot be
        exposed publicly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Government policy requires specific data to be kept in-country or
        privately.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Advantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Control - Organizations have complete control over the resources.</li>
      <li>Security - Organizations have complete control over security.</li>
      <li>
        Compliance - If organizations have very strict security, compliance, or
        legal requirements.
      </li>
      <li>Specific scenarios</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Disadvantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Upfront CapEx</li>
      <li>Not as agile as public clouds</li>
      <li>
        Maintenance - Organizations have the responsibility for hardware
        maintenance and updates.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skills - Private clouds require in-house IT skills and expertise that
        may be hard to get or be costly.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hybrid cloud</h3>
    <p>
      A hybrid cloud combines both public and private clouds, allowing you to
      run your applications in the most appropriate location. Hybrid cloud
      models have the following characteristics:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Resource location</b> - Specific resources run or are used in a
        public cloud, and others run or are used in a private cloud.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cost and efficiency. Hybrid cloud models allow an organization to
        leverage some of the benefits of cost, efficiency, and scale that are
        available with a public cloud model.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Control</b> - Organizations retain management control in private
        clouds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Skills</b> - Technical skills are still required to maintain the
        private cloud and ensure both cloud models can operate together.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Advantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Flexibility to use private cloud or in a public cloud.</li>
      <li>
        Costs - Organizations can take advantage of economies of scale from
        public cloud providers for services and resources as they wish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Control - Organizations can still access resources over which they have
        total control.
      </li>
      <li>
        Security - Organizations can still access resources for which they are
        responsible for security.
      </li>
      <li>Compliance - maintain compliance, or legal requirements.</li>
      <li>Specific scenarios</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Disadvantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Upfront CapEx for private cloud.</li>
      <li>Costs - Purchasing and maintaining a private cloud.</li>
      <li>
        Skills - Deep technical skills are still required to be able to set up a
        private cloud.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ease of management - Organizations need to ensure there are clear
        guidelines to avoid confusion, complications or misuse.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h3>Types of cloud services</h3>
    <p>
      When talking about cloud computing services, there are three major
      categories: IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Shared responsibility model</b>
      <br />
      Depending on the service you are using, the cloud provider is responsible
      for some aspects of the workload management, and the customer or end user
      is responsible for other aspects of the workload management, and in some
      cases, both share a responsibility.
    </p>
    <a
      href="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/shared-responsibility.png"
    >
      <img
        src="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/shared-responsibility.png"
      />
    </a>
    <ul>
      <li>
        IaaS requires the most user management of all the cloud services. The
        user is responsible for managing the operating systems, data, and
        applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        PaaS requires less user management. The cloud provider manages the
        operating systems, and the user is responsible for the applications and
        data they run and store.
      </li>
      <li>
        SaaS requires the least amount of management. The cloud provider is
        responsible for managing everything, and the end user just uses the
        software.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h3>
    <p>
      Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the most basic category of cloud
      computing services. You rent IT infrastructure servers and virtual
      machines (VMs), storage, networks, and operating systems from a cloud
      provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.
    </p>

    <p><b>IaaS characteristics </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Upfront costs. IaaS has no upfront costs. Users pay only for what they
        consume.
      </li>
      <li>
        User ownership. The user is responsible for the purchase, installation,
        configuration, and management of their own software operating systems,
        middleware, and applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cloud provider ownership. The cloud provider is responsible for ensuring
        that the underlying cloud infrastructure is available for the user.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Common IaaS usage scenarios</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Migrating workloads</li>
      <li>
        Test and development. Teams can quickly set up and dismantle test and
        development environments, bringing new applications to market faster.
      </li>
      <li>
        Website hosting. Running websites using IaaS can be less expensive than
        traditional web hosting.
      </li>
      <li>Storage, backup, and recovery</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Advantages </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No CapEx. Users have no upfront costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Agility. Applications can be made accessible quickly, and deprovisioned
        whenever needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consumption-based model
      </li>
      <li>
        Skills. No deep technical skills are required to deploy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cloud benefits. Organizations can leverage the skills and expertise of
        the cloud provider.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flexibility: IaaS is the most flexible cloud service.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Disadvantages</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Management. The shared responsibility model applies; the user manages
        and maintains the services they have provisioned, and the cloud provider
        manages and maintains the cloud infrastructure.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3>
    <p>
      Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides an environment for building,
      testing, and deploying software applications.
    </p>

    <p><b>PaaS characteristics </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Upfront costs. There are no upfront costs, and users pay only for what
        they consume.
      </li>
      <li>
        User ownership. The user is responsible for the development of their own
        applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cloud provider ownership. The cloud provider is responsible for
        operating system management, and network and service configuration.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Common PaaS usage scenarios </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Development framework. PaaS provides a framework that developers can
        build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Analytics or business intelligence. Tools provided as a service with
        PaaS allow organizations to analyze and mine their data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Advantages </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No CapEx. Users have no upfront costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Agility. PaaS is more agile than IaaS.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consumption-based model. Users pay only for what they use, and operate
        on an OpEx model.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skills. No deep technical skills are required to deploy, use, and gain
        the benefits of PaaS.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cloud benefits. Users can leverage the skills and expertise of the cloud
        provider.
      </li>
      <li>
        Productivity. Users can focus on application development only.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Disadvantages</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Platform limitations. There may be some limitations to a cloud platform
        that could affect how an application runs.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h3>
    <p>
      Software as a Service (SaaS) is software that is centrally hosted and
      managed for the end customer. It allows users to connect to and use
      cloud-based apps over the internet.
    </p>

    <p><b>SaaS characteristics </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Upfront costs. Users have no upfront costs; they pay a subscription,
        typically on a monthly or annual basis.
      </li>
      <li>
        User ownership. Users just use the application software.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cloud provider ownership. The cloud provider is responsible for the
        provision, management, and maintenance of the application software.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Common SaaS usage scenarios </b></p>
    <p>
      Common examples are email, calendars, and office tools such as Microsoft
      Office 365.
    </p>

    <p><b>Advantages </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No CapEx. Users don’t have any upfront costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Agility. Users can provide staff with access to the latest software
        quickly and easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pay-as-you-go pricing model: Users pay for the software they use on a

    <div id="navh02"></div>
    <div style="padding-top: 2em;"></div>
    <h2>Core Azure services</h2>
    <p><a href="#TOP">[TOP]</a></p>

    <p>Typically, cloud services include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Compute power</b> - such as Linux servers or web applications.</li>
      <li><b>Storage</b> - such as files and databases.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Networking</b> - such as secure connections between the cloud
        provider and your company.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Analytics</b> - such as visualizing telemetry and performance data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Compute power</h3>
    <p>
      Cloud-based servers that are processing each request and returning a
      response.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Virtual machine (VM)</b>
        <br />
        A VM is an emulation of a computer - just like your desktop or laptop
        you're using now. Each VM includes an operating system and hardware that
        appears to the user like a physical computer running Windows or Linux.
        You can then install whatever software you need to do the tasks you want
        to run in the cloud.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Containers</b>
        <br />
        Containers provide a consistent, isolated execution environment for
        applications. They're similar to VMs except they don't require a guest
        operating system. Instead, the application and all its dependencies is
        packaged into a "container" and then a standard runtime environment is
        used to execute the app. The open-source project, Docker, is one of the
        leading platforms for managing containers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Serverless computing</b>
        <br />
        Serverless computing lets you run application code without creating,
        configuring, or maintaining a server. The core idea is that your
        application is broken into separate functions that run when triggered by
        some action. This is ideal for automated tasks - for example, you can
        build a serverless process that automatically sends an email
        confirmation after a customer makes an online purchase.
      </li>
    </ul>

      />
    </a>

    <h3>Storage</h3>
    <p>
      Cloud providers typically offer storage services that can handle all of
      these types of data.The advantage to using cloud-based data storage is you
      can scale to meet your needs. In some cases, the storage can even expand
      and contract automatically.
