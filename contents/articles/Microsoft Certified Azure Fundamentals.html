    <h2>Cloud Concepts</h2>
    <p><a href="#TOP">[TOP]</a></p>

    <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>

    <p>
      Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services—servers, storage,
      databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence and more—over the
      internet (the cloud), enabling faster innovation, flexible resources, and
      economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use,
      helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more
      efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.
      <br />
      The company providing these services is referred to as a cloud provider.
      Some example providers are Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and
      the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
    </p>

    <h3>Key cloud concepts</h3>
    <p>
      Cloud services have characteristics and considerations, some of which are
      outlined and explained below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>High availability</b> - The ability to keep services up and running
        for long periods of time, with very little downtime.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Scalability</b> - The ability to increase or decrease resources for
        any given workload.
        <br />
        <b>Scaling out</b> - To add additional resources to service a workload
        <br />
        <b>Scaling up</b> - To add additional capabilities to manage an increase
        in demand to the existing resource. A distinction between scalability
        and elasticity is that elasticity is done automatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Elasticity</b> - The ability to automatically or dynamically increase
        or decrease resources as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Agility</b> - The ability to react quickly. Cloud services can
        allocate and deallocate resources quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Fault tolerance</b> - The ability to remain up and running even in
        the event of a component (or service) no longer functioning. Typically,
        redundancy is built into cloud services architecture, so if one
        component fails, a backup component takes its place. This type of
        service is said to be tolerant of faults.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Disaster recovery</b> - The ability to recover from an event which
        has taken down a cloud service. Cloud services disaster recovery can
        happen very quickly, with automation and services being readily
        available to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Global reach</b> - The ability to reach audiences around the globe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Customer latency capabilities</b> - Cloud services have the ability
        to deploy resources in datacenters around the globe, which addresses any
        customer latency issues.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Predictive cost considerations</b> - The ability for users to predict
        the costs they will incur for a particular cloud service.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Technical skill requirements and considerations</b> - Cloud services
        can provide and manage hardware and software for workloads. Getting a
        workload up and running with cloud services demands less technical
        resources than having IT teams build and maintain a physical
        infrastructure for handling the same workload.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Increased productivity</b> - On-site datacenters typically require a
        lot of hardware setup (otherwise known as racking and stacking),
        software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Security</b> Cloud providers offer a broad set of policies,
        technologies, controls, and expert technology skills that can provide
        better security than most organizations can otherwise achieve.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h3>CapEx vs OpEx</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Capital Expenditure (CapEx)</b> - This is the up front spending of
      money on physical infrastructure, and then deducting that up front expense
      over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Operational Expenditure (OpEx)</b> - This is spending money on services
      or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense
      in the same year you spend it. There is no up front cost, as you pay for a
      service or product as you use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, organizations can sign up for a service from a cloud provider to
      get up and running without the need for a significant investment into up
      front costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical on-premises datacenter includes costs such as: Server costs ,
      Storage costs, Network costs, Backup and archive costs, continuity and
      disaster recovery costs, datacenter infrastructure costs, Technical
      personnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Benefits of CapEx</b>
      <br />
      With capital expenditures, you plan your expenses at the start of a
      project or budget period.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Benefits of OpEx</b>
      <br />
      Demand and growth can be unpredictable and can outpace expectation, which
      is a challenge for the CapEx model as shown in the following graph. OpEx
      is particularly appealing if the demand fluctuates or to try a new product
      or service.

    </a>

    <h3>Consumption-based models</h3>
    <p>
      Users only pay for the resources that they use. A consumption-based model
      has many benefits, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>No upfront costs.</li>
      <li>No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure.</li>
      <li>The ability to pay for additional resources when they are needed.</li>
      <li>
        The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h3>Types of cloud models</h3>
    <p>There are three different cloud deployment models.</p>

    <h3>Public cloud</h3>
    <p>
      A public cloud is owned by the cloud services provider. This is the most
      common deployment model. Public cloud models have the following
      characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Ownership</b> - Resources are owned and operated by a third party,
        such as the cloud service provider.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Multiple end users</b> - Public cloud modes may make their resources
        available to multiple organizations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Public access</b> - Public access allows the public to access the
        desired cloud services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Availability</b> - Public cloud is the most common cloud-type
        deployment model.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Connectivity</b> - Users and organizations are typically connected to
        the public cloud over the internet using a web browser.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Skills</b> - Public clouds do not require deep technical knowledge to
        set up and use its resources.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Advantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>No CapEx</li>
      <li>Agility - deprovisioned whenever needed.</li>
      <li>Consumption-based model</li>
      <li>No responsibility for hardware maintenance or updates.</li>
      <li>
        No deep technical skills are required to deploy, use, and gain the
        benefits of a public cloud./li>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Disadvantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Security - There may be specific security requirements.</li>
      <li>
        Compliance - There may be government policies, industry standards, or
        legal requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ownership - Organizations don't own the hardware or services and cannot
        manage them as they may wish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Specific scenarios - If organizations have a unique business requirement
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Private cloud</h3>
    <p>
      A private cloud is owned and operated by the organization that uses the
      resources from that cloud. Private cloud models have the following
      characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Ownership</b> - The owner and user of the cloud services are the
        same.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Hardware</b> - The owner is entirely responsible for the purchase,
        maintenance, and management of the cloud hardware.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Users</b> - A private cloud operates only within one organization and
        cloud computing resources are used exclusively by a single business or
        organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Connectivity</b> - A connection to a private cloud is typically made
        over a private network that is highly secure.
      </li>
      <li><b>Public access</b> - Does not provide access to the public.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Skills</b> - Requires deep technical knowledge to set up, manage, and
        maintain.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A use case scenario for a private cloud are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Legal reasons. For example, they may have medical data that cannot be
        exposed publicly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Government policy requires specific data to be kept in-country or
        privately.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Advantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Control - Organizations have complete control over the resources.</li>
      <li>Security - Organizations have complete control over security.</li>
      <li>
        Compliance - If organizations have very strict security, compliance, or
        legal requirements.
      </li>
      <li>Specific scenarios</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Disadvantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Upfront CapEx</li>
      <li>Not as agile as public clouds</li>
      <li>
        Maintenance - Organizations have the responsibility for hardware
        maintenance and updates.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skills - Private clouds require in-house IT skills and expertise that
        may be hard to get or be costly.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hybrid cloud</h3>
    <p>
      A hybrid cloud combines both public and private clouds, allowing you to
      run your applications in the most appropriate location. Hybrid cloud
      models have the following characteristics:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Resource location</b> - Specific resources run or are used in a
        public cloud, and others run or are used in a private cloud.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cost and efficiency. Hybrid cloud models allow an organization to
        leverage some of the benefits of cost, efficiency, and scale that are
        available with a public cloud model.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Control</b> - Organizations retain management control in private
        clouds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Skills</b> - Technical skills are still required to maintain the
        private cloud and ensure both cloud models can operate together.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Advantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Flexibility to use private cloud or in a public cloud.</li>
      <li>
        Costs - Organizations can take advantage of economies of scale from
        public cloud providers for services and resources as they wish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Control - Organizations can still access resources over which they have
        total control.
      </li>
      <li>
        Security - Organizations can still access resources for which they are
        responsible for security.
      </li>
      <li>Compliance - maintain compliance, or legal requirements.</li>
      <li>Specific scenarios</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Disadvantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Upfront CapEx for private cloud.</li>
      <li>Costs - Purchasing and maintaining a private cloud.</li>
      <li>
        Skills - Deep technical skills are still required to be able to set up a
        private cloud.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ease of management - Organizations need to ensure there are clear
        guidelines to avoid confusion, complications or misuse.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h3>Types of cloud services</h3>
    <p>
      When talking about cloud computing services, there are three major
      categories: IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Shared responsibility model</b>
      <br />
      Depending on the service you are using, the cloud provider is responsible
      for some aspects of the workload management, and the customer or end user
      is responsible for other aspects of the workload management, and in some
      cases, both share a responsibility.
    </p>
    <a
      href="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/shared-responsibility.png"
    >
      <img
        src="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/shared-responsibility.png"
        width="700px"
      />
    </a>
    <ul>
      <li>
        IaaS requires the most user management of all the cloud services. The
        user is responsible for managing the operating systems, data, and
        applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        PaaS requires less user management. The cloud provider manages the
        operating systems, and the user is responsible for the applications and
        data they run and store.
      </li>
      <li>
        SaaS requires the least amount of management. The cloud provider is
        responsible for managing everything, and the end user just uses the
        software.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h3>
    <p>
      Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the most basic category of cloud
      computing services. You rent IT infrastructure servers and virtual
      machines (VMs), storage, networks, and operating systems from a cloud
      provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.
    </p>

    <p><b>IaaS characteristics </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Upfront costs. IaaS has no upfront costs. Users pay only for what they
        consume.
      </li>
      <li>
        User ownership. The user is responsible for the purchase, installation,
        configuration, and management of their own software operating systems,
        middleware, and applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cloud provider ownership. The cloud provider is responsible for ensuring
        that the underlying cloud infrastructure is available for the user.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Common IaaS usage scenarios</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Migrating workloads</li>
      <li>
        Test and development. Teams can quickly set up and dismantle test and
        development environments, bringing new applications to market faster.
      </li>
      <li>
        Website hosting. Running websites using IaaS can be less expensive than
        traditional web hosting.
      </li>
      <li>Storage, backup, and recovery</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Advantages </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No CapEx. Users have no upfront costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Agility. Applications can be made accessible quickly, and deprovisioned
        whenever needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consumption-based model
      </li>
      <li>
        Skills. No deep technical skills are required to deploy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cloud benefits. Organizations can leverage the skills and expertise of
        the cloud provider.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flexibility: IaaS is the most flexible cloud service.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Disadvantages</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Management. The shared responsibility model applies; the user manages
        and maintains the services they have provisioned, and the cloud provider
        manages and maintains the cloud infrastructure.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3>
    <p>
      Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides an environment for building,
      testing, and deploying software applications.
    </p>

    <p><b>PaaS characteristics </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Upfront costs. There are no upfront costs, and users pay only for what
        they consume.
      </li>
      <li>
        User ownership. The user is responsible for the development of their own
        applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cloud provider ownership. The cloud provider is responsible for
        operating system management, and network and service configuration.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Common PaaS usage scenarios </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Development framework. PaaS provides a framework that developers can
        build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Analytics or business intelligence. Tools provided as a service with
        PaaS allow organizations to analyze and mine their data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Advantages </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No CapEx. Users have no upfront costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Agility. PaaS is more agile than IaaS.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consumption-based model. Users pay only for what they use, and operate
        on an OpEx model.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skills. No deep technical skills are required to deploy, use, and gain
        the benefits of PaaS.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cloud benefits. Users can leverage the skills and expertise of the cloud
        provider.
      </li>
      <li>
        Productivity. Users can focus on application development only.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Disadvantages</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Platform limitations. There may be some limitations to a cloud platform
        that could affect how an application runs.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h3>
    <p>
      Software as a Service (SaaS) is software that is centrally hosted and
      managed for the end customer. It allows users to connect to and use
      cloud-based apps over the internet.
    </p>

    <p><b>SaaS characteristics </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Upfront costs. Users have no upfront costs; they pay a subscription,
        typically on a monthly or annual basis.
      </li>
      <li>
        User ownership. Users just use the application software.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cloud provider ownership. The cloud provider is responsible for the
        provision, management, and maintenance of the application software.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Common SaaS usage scenarios </b></p>
    <p>
      Common examples are email, calendars, and office tools such as Microsoft
      Office 365.
    </p>

    <p><b>Advantages </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No CapEx. Users don’t have any upfront costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Agility. Users can provide staff with access to the latest software
        quickly and easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pay-as-you-go pricing model: Users pay for the software they use on a
        subscription model, typically monthly or yearly, regardless of how much
        they use the software.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flexibility. Users can access the same application data from anywhere.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Disadvantages</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Software limitations. There may be some limitations to a software
        application that might affect how users work.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Core Azure architectural components</h3>

    <h3>Regions</h3>
    <p>
      A region is a geographical area on the planet containing at least one, but
      potentially multiple datacenters that are in close proximity and networked
      together with a low-latency network. A few examples of regions are West
      US, Canada Central, West Europe, Australia East, and Japan West. At the
      time of writing this, Azure is generally available in 55 regions and
      available in 140 countries.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Azure has more global regions than any other cloud provider.</li>
      <li>
        Regions provide customers the flexibility and scale needed to bring
        applications closer to their users.
      </li>
      <li>
        Regions preserve data residency and offer comprehensive compliance and
        resiliency options for customers.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Special Azure regions </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more: These are
        physical and logical network-isolated instances of Azure for US
        government agencies and partners.
      </li>
      <li>
        China East, China North and more: These regions are available through a
        unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, whereby Microsoft
        does not directly maintain the datacenters.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Region Pairs</h3>
    <p>
      Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography
      (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away, which together make
      a region pair.
    </p>
    <a href="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/regional-pairs.png">
      <img
        src="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/regional-pairs.png"
        width="400px"
      />
    </a>
    <p><b>Benefits</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Physical isolation - Physical datacenter separation reduces the
        likelihood of natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or
        physical network outages affecting both regions at once.
      </li>
      <li>Platform-provided replication</li>
      <li>Region recovery order</li>
      <li>Sequential updates</li>
      <li></li>
      <li>Planned Azure updates</li>
      <li>Tax and law enforcement jurisdiction purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Geographies</h3>
    <p>
      Azure divides the world into geographies that are defined by geopolitical
      boundaries or country borders. An Azure geography is a discrete market
      typically containing two or more regions that preserves data residency and
      compliance boundaries.
    </p>

    <p><b>Benefits</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Geographies allow customers with specific data residency and compliance
        needs to keep their data and applications close.
      </li>
      <li>
        Geographies ensure that data residency, sovereignty, compliance, and
        resiliency requirements are honored within geographical boundaries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Geographies are fault-tolerant to withstand complete region failure
        through their connection to dedicated high-capacity networking
        infrastructure.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Geographies are broken up into the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Americas</li>
      <li>Europe</li>
      <li>Asia Pacific</li>
      <li>Middle East and Africa</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Availability Options</h3>

    <a href="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/availability-options.png">
      <img
        src="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/availability-options.png"
      />
    </a>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A single virtual machine with premium storage has an SLA of 99.9%.
      </li>
      <li>
        By placing virtual machines in an availability set, you protect against
        datacenter failures and increases the SLA to 99.95%.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adding virtual machines to availability zones protects from entire
        datacenter failures and increases the SLA to 99.99%, which is highest
        level of protection that is provided.
      </li>
      <li>
        For multi-region disaster recovery, region pairs protect and provide
        data residency boundaries.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Availability sets</h3>
    <p>
      Availability sets are a way for you to ensure your application remains
      online if a high-impact maintenance event is required, or if a hardware
      failure occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Availability sets are made up of Update domains (UD) and Fault domains
      (FD).
      <br />
      <b>Update domains</b> - When a maintenance event occurs.
      <br />
      <b>Fault domains</b>
      provide for the physical separation of your workload across different
      hardware in the datacenter.
    </p>
    <h3>Availability Zones</h3>
    <p>
      Availability zones are physically separate locations within an Azure
      region that use availability sets to provide additional fault tolerance.
      The availability zones are typically connected to each other through very
      fast, private fiber-optic networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can co-locating your compute, storage, networking, and data resources
      within a zone and replicating in other zones.
      <br />
      Zonal services – you pin the resource to a specific zone
      <br />
      Zone-redundant services – platform replicates automatically across zones
    </p>

    <hr />
    <h3>Resource groups</h3>
    <p>
      A resource group is a unit of management for your resources in Azure. You
      can manage and apply the following resources at resource group level:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><Metering and billing /li></li>
      <li>Policies</li>
      <li>Monitoring and alerts</li>
      <li>Quotas</li>
      <li>Access control</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Remember that when you delete a resource group you delete all resources
      contained within it.
    </p>

    <p><b>Considerations </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each resource must exist in one, and only one, resource group.</li>
      <li>
        A resource group can contain resources that reside in different regions.
      </li>
      <li>You can add or remove a resource to a resource group at any time.</li>
      <li>You can move a resource from one resource group to another.</li>
      <li>
        It is recommended that you keep an application in the same resource
        group for ease of management.
      </li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Logical grouping </b></p>
    <p>
      By placing resources of similar usage, type, or location, you can provide
      some order and organization to resources you create in Azure.
    </p>

    <p><b>Life cycle </b></p>
    <p>
      Resource groups make it easy to remove a set of resources at once which
      can be useful in non-production environments.
    </p>

    <p><b>Authorization </b></p>
    <p>
      Resource groups are also a scope for applying role-based access control
      (RBAC) permissions.
    </p>

    <p><b>Create a resource group </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Azure portal</li>
      <li>Azure PowerShell</li>
      <li>Azure CLI</li>
      <li>Templates</li>
      <li>Azure SDKs (like .NET, Java)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Guidelines</h3>
    <p>Consistent naming convention</p>
    <p>Resource groups can be organized in a number of ways.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>By resource type - vnet-rg, vm-rg, db-rg</li>
      <li>By environment - dev-rg, prod-rg, qa-rg</li>
      <li>By department - finance-rg, marketing-rg, hr-rg</li>
      <li>
        Combination of these strategies and organize by environment and
        department - prod-finance-rg, dev-finance-rg
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Azure Resource Manager</h3>
    <p>
      Azure Resource Manager is a management layer in which resource groups and
      all the resources within it are created, configured, managed, and deleted.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Deploy Application resources
      </li>
      <li>
        Organize resources
      </li>
      <li>Control access and resources</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Azure Hierarchy</h2>
    <p>
      Azure Hierarchy provides a management layer that enables you to create,
      update, and delete resoures in your azure subscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hierarchy Layers</b>
      <br />
      [Management groups]
      <br />
      [Subscriptions]

    <h2>Core Azure services</h2>
    <p><a href="#TOP">[TOP]</a></p>

    <p>
      <b>Azure compute</b> is an on-demand computing service for running
      cloud-based applications. It provides computing resources such as disks,
      processors, memory, networking and operating systems.Typically, cloud
      services include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Compute power</b> - such as Linux servers or web applications.</li>
      <li><b>Storage</b> - such as files and databases.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Networking</b> - such as secure connections between the cloud
        provider and your company.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Analytics</b> - such as visualizing telemetry and performance data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>Compute power</h2>
    <p>
      Cloud-based servers that are processing each request and returning a
      response. Some of common compute powers are VM, Containers and Serverless.
    </p>

    >
      <img
        src="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/2-virtual-machine-versus-container-versus-serverless.png"
      />
    </a>

    <h3>Virtual machine (VM)</h3>
    <p>
      A VM is an emulation of a computer - just like your desktop or laptop
      you're using now. Each VM includes an operating system and hardware that
      appears to the user like a physical computer running Windows or Linux. You
      can then install whatever software you need to do the tasks you want to
      run in the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Azure supports a wide range of computing solutions for development and
      testing, running applications, and extending your datacenter, including
      Linux, Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM, and SAP.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Virtual machine scale sets </b>
      <br />
      Virtual machine scale sets are an Azure compute resource that you can use
      to deploy and manage a set of identical VMs to support true autoscale and
      containerized workloads.
    </p>

        target="_blank"
        >Link</a
      >
    </p>

    <h3>Container services</h3>
    <p>
      Containers provide a consistent, isolated execution environment for
      applications. They're similar to VMs except they don't require a guest
      operating system. Instead, the application and all its dependencies is
      packaged into a "container" and then a standard runtime environment is
      used to execute the app. The open-source project, Docker, is one of the
      leading platforms for managing containers. VM virtualises machine,
      container virtualises OS.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two ways to manage both Docker and Microsoft-based containers in
      Azure.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Azure Container Instances</b> offers the fastest and simplest way to
        run a container in Azure without having to manage any virtual machines
        or adopt any additional services. It is a PaaS offering that allows you
        to upload your containers, which it will run for you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</b> is a complete orchestration
        service for containers with distributed architectures and large volumes
        of containers. Orchestration is the task of automating and managing a
        large number of containers and how they interact.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Microservice architecture</h3>
    <p>
      This architecture is where you break solutions into smaller, independent
      pieces. For example, you may split a website into a container hosting your
      front end, another hosting your back end, and a third for storage. This
      split allows you to separate portions of your app into logical sections
      that can be maintained, scaled, or updated independently.
    </p>

    <h3>Migrate apps to containers</h3>

    <a

    >
      <img
        src="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/4-kubernetes-migration.png"
      />
    </a>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You convert an existing application to one or more containers and then
        publish one or more container images to the Azure Container Registry.
      </li>
      <li>
        By using the Azure portal or the command line, you deploy the containers
        to an AKS cluster.
      </li>
      <li>Azure AD controls access to AKS resources.</li>
      <li>
        You access SLA-backed Azure services, such as Azure Database for MySQL,
        via OSBA.
      </li>
      <li>Optionally, AKS is deployed with a virtual network.</li>
    </ul>

      </a>
    </p>

    <h3>Serverless computing</h3>
    <p>
      Serverless computing lets you run application code without creating,
      configuring, or maintaining a server. The core idea is that your
      application is broken into separate functions that run when triggered by
      some action. This is ideal for automated tasks - for example, you can
      build a serverless process that automatically sends an email confirmation
      after a customer makes an online purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      An event could be a REST endpoint, a periodic timer, or even a message
      received from another Azure service.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Azure Functions </b>
      <br />
      Azure Functions are ideal when you're concerned only about the code
      running your service and not the underlying platform or infrastructure.
      Azure Functions are commonly used when you need to perform work in
      response to an event—often via a REST request, timer, or message from
      another Azure service—and when that work can be completed quickly, within
      seconds or less.
      <br />
      Azure Functions scale automatically, and charges accrue only when a
      function is triggered, so they're a solid choice when demand is variable.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Azure Logic Apps </b>
      <br />
      Logic Apps is a cloud service that helps you automate and orchestrate
      tasks, business processes, and workflows when you need to integrate apps,
      data, systems, and services across enterprises or organizations.
      <br />
      Logic Apps are designed in a web-based designer and can execute logic
      triggered by Azure services without writing any code.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Azure Event Grid </b>
      <br />
      Event Grid allows you to easily build applications with event-based
      architectures. It's a fully managed, intelligent event routing service
      that uses a publish-subscribe model for uniform event consumption.
      <br />
      You can use Event Grid to support your own non-Azure-based events in
      near-real time, using custom topics. You can use filters to route specific
      events to different endpoints, and ensure your events are reliably
      delivered.

    <hr />

    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Cloud providers typically offer storage services that can handle all of
      these types of data.The advantage to using cloud-based data storage is you
      can scale to meet your needs. In some cases, the storage can even expand
      and contract automatically.
    </p>

    <h3>Azure data categories</h3>
    <p>
      You can generally think of data as structured, semi-structured, and
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Structured data </b>
      <br />
      Structured data is also known as relational data. The data's schema
      defines the table of data, the fields in the table, and the clear
      relationship between the two. Structured data can be stored in a database
      table with rows and columns. Structured data is easy to enter, query, and
      analyze because all the data follows the same format.
      <br /><b>Examples</b> of structured data include sensor data or financial
      data.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Structured data </b>
      <br />
      Semi-structured data is also known as non-relational or NoSQL data.
      Semi-structured data is less organized than structured data.
      Semi-structured data is not stored in a relational format, meaning the
      fields do not neatly fit into tables, rows, and columns. Semi-structured
      data contains tags that make the organization and hierarchy of the data
      apparent.
      <br />
      <b>Examples</b> of semi-structured data include books, blogs, and HTML
      documents.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Unstructured data </b>
      <br />
      Unstructured data has no designated structure. Unstructured data can hold
      any kind of data. Unstructured data is becoming more prominent as
      businesses try to tap into new data sources.

      <br />
      <b>Examples</b> Examples of unstructured data include a PDF document, a
      JPG image, a JSON file, and video content.

    <br />

    <h2>Azure Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Azure Storage is a service that you can use to store files, messages,
      tables, and other types of information. Azure Storage is also used by IaaS
      virtual machines, and PaaS cloud services. Some of the most common storage
      service types in Azure are disks, files, objects, queues, and tables.
    </p>

    <h3>Disk storage</h3>
    <p>
      Disk storage provides disks for virtual machines, applications, and other
      services to access and use as they need, similar to how they would in
      on-premises scenarios. Disks come in many different sizes and performance
      levels, from solid-state drives (SSDs) to traditional spinning hard disk
      drives (HDDs), with varying performance abilities.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Containers (Blobs)</h3>
    <p>
      Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud.
      Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured
      data, such as text or binary data.
    </p>
    <p>Blob storage is ideal for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Serving images or documents directly to a browser.</li>
      <li>Storing files for distributed access.</li>
      <li>Streaming video and audio.</li>
      <li>
        Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>Files</h3>
    <p>
      Azure Files enables you to set up highly available network file shares
      that can be accessed by using the standard Server Message Block (SMB)
      protocol. That means that multiple VMs can share the same files with both
      read and write access. You can also read the files using the REST
      interface or the storage client libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing that distinguishes Azure Files from files on a corporate file
      share is that you can access the files from anywhere in the world using a
      URL that points to the file and includes a shared access signature (SAS)
      token.
    </p>
    <p>File shares can be used for many common scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Many on-premises applications use file shares. This feature makes it
        easier to migrate those applications that share data to Azure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Configuration files can be stored on a file share and accessed from
        multiple VMs. Tools and utilities used by multiple developers in a group
        can be stored on a file share, ensuring that everybody can find them,
        and that they use the same version.
      </li>
      <li>
        Diagnostic logs, metrics, and crash dumps are just three examples of
        data that can be written to a file share and processed or analyzed
        later.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>Queues</h3>
    <p>
      The Azure Queue service is used to store and retrieve messages. Queue
      messages can be up to 64 KB in size, and a queue can contain millions of
      messages. Queues are generally used to store lists of messages to be
      processed asynchronously.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, say you want your customers to be able to upload pictures,
      and you want to create thumbnails for each picture. When the customer
      finishes their upload, write a message to the queue. Then have an Azure
      Function retrieve the message from the queue and create the thumbnails.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Tables</h3>
    <p>
      Azure Table storage stores large amounts of structured data. The service
      is a NoSQL datastore which accepts authenticated calls from inside and
      outside the Azure cloud. Azure tables are ideal for storing structured,
      non-relational data. Common uses of Table storage include:
    </p>
    <p>Common uses of Table storage include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Storing TBs of structured data capable of serving web scale
        applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Storing datasets that don't require complex joins, foreign keys, or
        stored procedures and can be denormalized for fast access.
      </li>
      <li>Quickly querying data using a clustered index.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Microsoft Azure security, privacy, compliance, and trust</h2>
    <p><a href="#TOP">[TOP]</a></p>
    <p>
      Every system, architecture, and application needs to be designed with
      security in mind, whether on-premises or in the cloud.
    </p>

    <h2>Defense in depth</h2>
    <p>
      Defense in depth is a strategy that employs a series of mechanisms to slow
      the advance of an attack aimed at acquiring unauthorized access to data.
      The objective of defense in depth is to protect and prevent information
      from being stolen by individuals not authorized to access it. The common
      principles used to define a security posture are confidentiality,
      integrity, and availability, known collectively as CIA.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Confidentiality</b> - The Principle of least privilege restricts
        access to information only to individuals explicitly granted access.
        This information includes protection of user passwords, remote access
        certificates, and email content.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Integrity</b> - The prevention of unauthorized changes to information
        at rest or in transit. A common approach used in data transmission is
        for the sender to create a unique fingerprint of the data using a
        one-way hashing algorithm.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Availability</b> - Ensure services are available to authorized users.
        Denial of service attacks are a prevalent cause of loss of availability
        to users.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Defense in depth can be visualized as a set of layers, with the Data to be
      secured at the center. Each layer provides protection so that if one layer
      is breached, a subsequent layer is already in place to prevent further
      exposure.
    </p>

      />
    </a>

    <h3>Physical security</h3>
    <p>
      ・Physical building security and controlling access to computing hardware
      within the data center is the first line of defense.
      <br />
      ・With physical security, the intent is to provide physical safeguards
      against access to assets. These safeguards ensure that other layers can't
      be bypassed, and loss or theft is handled appropriately.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Identity and access</h3>
    <p>
      ・Control access to infrastructure and change control.
      <br />
      ・Use single sign-on and multi-factor authentication.
      <br />
      ・Audit events and changes.
      <br />
      ・The identity and access layer is all about ensuring identities are
      secure, access granted is only what is needed, and changes are logged.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Perimeter</h3>
    <p>
      ・Use distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection to filter
      large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for end
      users.
      <br />
      ・Use perimeter firewalls to identify and alert on malicious attacks
      against your network.
      <br />
      ・At the network perimeter, it's about protecting from network-based
      attacks against your resources. Identifying these attacks, eliminating
      their impact, and alerting you when they happen are important ways to keep
      your network secure.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Networking</h3>
    <p>
      ・Limit communication between resources.
      <br />
      ・Deny by default.
      <br />
      ・Restrict inbound internet access and limit outbound, where appropriate.
      <br />
      ・Implement secure connectivity to on-premises networks.
      <br />
      ・At this layer, the focus is on limiting the network connectivity across
      all your resources to allow only what is required. By limiting this
      communication, you reduce the risk of lateral movement throughout your
      network.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Compute</h3>
    <p>
      ・Secure access to virtual machines.
      <br />
      ・Implement endpoint protection and keep systems patched and current.
      <br />
      ・Malware, unpatched systems, and improperly secured systems open your
      environment to attacks. The focus in this layer is on making sure your
      compute resources are secure, and that you have the proper controls in
      place to minimize security issues.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Application</h3>
    <p>
      ・Ensure applications are secure and free of vulnerabilities.
      <br />
      ・Store sensitive application secrets in a secure storage medium.
      <br />
      ・Make security a design requirement for all application development.
      <br />
      ・Integrating security into the application development life cycle will
      help reduce the number of vulnerabilities introduced in code. We encourage
      all development teams to ensure their applications are secure by default,
      and that they're making security requirements non-negotiable.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Data</h3>
    <p>
      ・In almost all cases, attackers are after data in a database, on disk
      inside virtual machines, on a SaaS application such as Office 365, in
      cloud and more.
      <br />
      ・It's the responsibility of those storing and controlling access to data
      to ensure that it's properly secured. Often, there are regulatory
      requirements that dictate the controls and processes that must be in place
      to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.
    </p>
    <br />

    <hr />

    <h2>Shared security</h2>
    <p>
      Azure helps alleviate your security concerns. But security is still a
      shared responsibility. How much of that responsibility falls on us depends
      on which model we use with Azure. We use the defense in depth rings as a
      guideline for considering what protections are adequate for our data and
      environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Microsoft applies a layered approach to security, both in our physical
      datacenters and across Azure services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Security of the operational environment is now a concern shared by both
      cloud providers and customers. By shifting these responsibilities to a
      cloud service like Azure, organizations can reduce focus on activities
      that aren't core business competencies.
    </p>

    <h2>Azure Firewall</h2>
    <p>
      A Firewall is a service that grants server access based on the originating
      IP address of each request. Firewall rules also include specific network
      protocol and port information.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can create, enforce, and log, application and network connectivity
      policies across subscriptions, and virtual networks, centrally.
    </p>

    <p>Azure Firewall provides many features, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Built-in high availability</li>
      <li>Unrestricted cloud scalability</li>
      <li>Inbound and outbound filtering rules</li>
      <li>Azure Monitor logging.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Common usage scenarios</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        You typically deploy Azure Firewall on a central virtual network to
        control general network access.
      </li>
      <li>
        Application rules that define fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) that
        can be accessed from a subnet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Network rules that define source address, protocol, destination port,
        and destination address.
      </li>
      <li>
        Azure Application Gateway also provides a firewall, called the Web
        Application Firewall (WAF).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>Azure Distributed Denial of Service protection</h2>
    <p>
      Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks attempt to overwhelm and
      exhaust an application’s resources, making the application slow or
      unresponsive to legitimate users. DDoS attacks can be targeted at any
      endpoint that is publicly reachable through the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Azure DDoS Protection service protects your Azure applications by
      scrubbing traffic at the Azure network edge before it can impact your
      service's availability.
    </p>

    <h3>Azure Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service tiers</h3>

    <p>
      Basic - The Basic service tier is automatically enabled as part of the
      Azure platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standard - The Standard service tier provides additional mitigation
      capabilities that are tuned specifically to Microsoft Azure Virtual
      Network resources. Protection policies are tuned through dedicated traffic
      monitoring and machine learning algorithms.
    </p>

    <h3>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) standard protection</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Volumetric attacks. The attack's goal is to flood the network layer with
        a substantial amount of seemingly legitimate traffic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Protocol attacks. These attacks render a target inaccessible, by
        exploiting a weakness in the layer 3 and layer 4 protocol stack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Resource (application) layer attacks. These attacks target web
        application packets to disrupt the transmission of data between hosts.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h2>Network Security Groups</h2>
    <p>
      Network Security Groups (NSG) allow you to filter network traffic to and
      from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. An NSG can contain
      multiple inbound and outbound security rules that enable you to filter
      traffic to and from resources by source and destination IP address, port,
      and protocol.
    </p>

    <h3>Network security rule properties</h3>

    <table class="t1">
      <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Explanation</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>Unique name of the Network Security Group (NSG).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Priority</td>
        <td>
          A number between 100 and 4096. Rules are processed in priority order,
          with lower numbers processed before higher numbers
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Source or Destination</td>
        <td>
          Individual IP address or IP address range, service tag, or application
          security group

        <td>Allow or Deny</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br />

    <hr />

    <h2>Application Security Groups</h2>
    <p>
      Application security groups (ASG) enable you to configure network security
      as a natural extension of an application's structure, allowing you to
      group virtual machines and define network security policies based on those
      groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Application Security Groups help simplify how you can filter and control
      network traffic coming into your organization and how that network traffic
      is allowed to move. They allow you to isolate multiple workloads and
      provide additional levels of protection for your virtual network in a more
      easily manageable way.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, we have ASGs defined for Web Servers, App Servers, and DB
      Servers and green and red arrows indicating which network traffic paths
      are allowable and which are not.
    </p>
    <hr />

    <h2>Choose Azure network security solutions</h2>
    <p>
      When considering your Azure security solution consider all the elements of
      defense in depth.
    </p>

    <h3>Perimeter layer</h3>
    <p>
      Use Azure DDoS Protection to filter large-scale attacks before they can
      cause a denial of service for end users.
      <br />
      Use perimeter firewalls with Azure Firewall to identify and alert on
      malicious attacks against your network.
    </p>

    <h3>Network layer</h3>
    <p>
      Use NSGs to create rules about inbound and outbound communication at this
      layer.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Limit communication between resources through segmenting your network
        and configuring access controls.
      </li>
      <li>Deny by default.</li>
      <li>
        Restrict inbound internet access and limit outbound where appropriate.
      </li>
      <li>Implement secure connectivity to on-premises networks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Combine services</h3>
    <p>
      You can also combine multiple Azure networking and security services to
      manage your network security and provide increased layered protection. The
      following are examples of combined services:
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Network security groups and Azure Firewall</b>
      <br />
      Network security groups provide distributed network layer traffic
      filtering to limit traffic to resources within virtual networks in each
      subscription.
      <br />
      Azure Firewall is a fully stateful, centralized network
      firewall-as-a-service, which provides network and application-level
      protection across different subscriptions and virtual networks.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Application Gateway WAF and Azure Firewall</b>
      <br />
      WAF is a feature of Application Gateway that provides your web
      applications with centralized, inbound protection against common exploits
      and vulnerabilities.
      <br />
      Azure Firewall provides inbound protection for non-HTTP/S protocols (for
      example, RDP, SSH, FTP), outbound network-level protection for all ports
      and protocols, and application-level protection for outbound HTTP/S.

    <h2>Authentication and Authorization</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Authentication (AuthN)</b> - Authentication is the process of
      establishing the identity of a person or service looking to access a
      resource. It establishes if they are who they say they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Authorization (AuthZ)</b> - Authorization is the process of
      establishing what level of access an authenticated person or service has.
      It specifies what data they're allowed to access and what they can do with
      it.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Azure Active Directory</h3>
    <p>
      Azure Active Directory is a Microsoft cloud-based identity and access
      management service. Azure AD helps employees of an organization sign in
      and access resources:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>External resources</b> might include Microsoft Office 365, the Azure
      portal, and thousands of other software as a service (SaaS) applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Internal resources</b> might include apps on your corporate network and
      intranet, along with any cloud apps developed by your own organization.
    </p>

    <p>Azure AD provides services such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Authentication. This includes verifying identity to access applications
        and resources, and providing functionality such as self-service password
        reset, multi-factor authentication (MFA), a custom banned password list,
        and smart lockout services.
      </li>
      <li>
        Single sign-on (SSO). Enables users to remember only one ID and one
        password to access multiple applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Application management. You can manage your cloud and on-premises apps
        using Azure AD Application Proxy, single sign-on, the My apps portal
        (also referred to as Access panel), and SaaS apps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Business to business (B2B) identity services. Manage your guest users
        and external partners while maintaining control over your own corporate
        data
      </li>
      <li>
        Business-to-customer (B2C) identity services. Customize and control how
        users sign up, sign in, and manage their profiles when using your apps
        with services.
      </li>
      <li>
        Device management. Manage how your cloud or on-premises devices access
        your corporate data.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Azure AD is intended for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        IT administrators. Administrators can use Azure AD to control access to
        apps and their resources, based on your business requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        App developers. Developers can use Azure AD to provide a standards-based
        approach for adding functionality to applications that you build, such
        as adding Single-Sign-On functionality to an app, or allowing an app to
        work with a user's pre-existing credentials and other functionality.
      </li>
      <li>
        Microsoft 365, Microsoft Office 365, Azure, or Microsoft Dynamics CRM
        Online subscribers. These subscribers are already using Azure AD.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Single sign-on</h3>
    <p>
      With single sign-on (SSO), users need to remember only one ID and one
      password. Access across applications is granted to a single identity tied
      to a user, simplifying the security model.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using a centralized identity provider, you'll have centralized the
      security controls, reporting, alerting, and administration of your
      identity infrastructure.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Azure Multi-Factor Authentication</h2>
    <p>
      Azure Multi-Factor Authentication provides additional security for your
      identities by requiring two or more elements for full authentication.
      These elements fall into three categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Something you know could be a password or the answer to a security
        question.
      </li>

      <li>
        Something you possess might be a mobile app that receives a
        notification, or a token-generating device.
      </li>
      <li>
        Something you are is typically some sort of biometric property, such as
        a fingerprint or face scan used on many mobile devices.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Multi-factor authentication (MFA) comes as part of the following Azure
      service offerings:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Azure Active Directory premium licenses</li>
      <li>Multi-factor authentication for Office 365</li>
      <li>Azure Active Directory global administrators</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h2>Azure Security Center</h2>
    <p>
      Azure Security Center is a monitoring service that provides threat
      protection across all of your services both in Azure, and on-premises.
      Security Center can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Provide security recommendations based on your configurations,
        resources, and networks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Monitor security settings across on-premises and cloud workloads, and
        automatically apply required security to new services as they come
        online.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continuously monitor all your services and perform automatic security
        assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities before they can be
        exploited.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use machine learning to detect and block malware from being installed on
        your virtual machines and services. You can also define a list of
        allowed applications to ensure that only the apps you validate can
        execute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Analyze and identify potential inbound attacks and help to investigate
        threats and any post-breach activity that might have occurred.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provide just-in-time access control for ports, reducing your attack
        surface by ensuring the network only allows traffic that you require.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Azure Security Center versions</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Free. Available as part of your Azure subscription, this tier is limited
        to assessments and recommendations of Azure resources only.
      </li>
      <li>
        Standard. This tier provides a full suite of security-related services
        including continuous monitoring, threat detection, just-in-time access
        control for ports, and more. To access the full suite of Azure Security
        Center services you will need to upgrade to a Standard tier
        subscription.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Vault</h2>

    <p>
      Azure Key Vault is a centralized cloud service for storing your
      applications' secrets. Key Vault helps you control your applications'
      secrets by keeping them in a single, central location and by providing
      secure access, permissions control, and access logging capabilities.
    </p>

    <p>Usage scenarios</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Secrets management. You can use Key Vault to securely store and tightly
        control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, Application
        Programming Interface (API) keys, and other secrets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Key management. You also can use Key Vault as a key management solution.
        Key Vault makes it easier to create and control the encryption keys used
        to encrypt your data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Certificate management. Key Vault lets you provision, manage, and deploy
        your public and private Secure Sockets Layer/ Transport Layer Security
        (SSL/ TLS) certificates for your Azure, and internally connected,
        resources more easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        Store secrets backed by hardware security modules (HSMs). The secrets
        and keys can be protected either by software, or by FIPS 140-2 Level 2
        validated HSMs.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Key Vault benefits</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Centralized application secrets. Centralizing storage for application
        secrets allows you to control their distribution and reduces the chances
        that secrets may be accidentally leaked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Securely stored secrets and keys. Azure uses industry-standard
        algorithms, key lengths, and HSMs, and access requires proper
        authentication and authorization.
      </li>
      <li>
        Monitor access and use. Using Key Vault, you can monitor and control
        access to company secrets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simplified administration of application secrets. Key Vault makes it
        easier to enroll and renew certificates from public Certificate
        Authorities (CAs). You can also scale up and replicate content within
        regions and use standard certificate management tools.
      </li>
      <li>
        Integrate with other Azure services. You can integrate Key Vault with
        storage accounts, container registries, event hubs and many more Azure
        services.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Azure Information Protection (AIP)</h2>

    <p>
      Azure Information Protection is a cloud-based solution that helps
      organizations classify and (optionally) protect its documents and emails
      by applying labels. Labels can be applied automatically (by administrators
      who define rules and conditions), manually (by users), or with a
      combination of both (where users are guided by recommendations).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can purchase MSIP either as a standalone solution, or through one of
      the following Microsoft licensing suites: Enterprise Mobility + Security,
      or Microsoft 365 Enterprise.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)</h2>
    <p>
      Azure Advanced Threat Protection is a cloud-based security solution that
      identifies, detects, and helps you investigate advanced threats,
      compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your
      organization. Azure ATP is capable of detecting known malicious attacks
      and techniques, security issues, and risks against your network.
    </p>
    <p>
      Azure Advanced Threat Protection is available as part of the Enterprise
      Mobility + Security 5 suite (EMS E5), and as a standalone license.
    </p>

    <h2>Define Azure policy</h2>
    <p>
      Azure Policy is a service in Azure that you use to create, assign, and,
      manage policies. These policies enforce different rules and effects over
      your resources, so those resources stay compliant with your corporate
      standards and service-level agreements (SLAs).
    </p>
    <p>
      It runs evaluations of your resources and scans for those not compliant
      with the policies you have created. Azure Policy also can automatically
      remediate resources and configurations that are deemed non-compliant, thus
      ensuring the integrity of the state of the resources.
    </p>

    <p>There are three steps to creating an implementing an Azure policy.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Create a policy definition - A policy definition expresses what to
        evaluate and what action to take. For example, Allowed storage account
        SKUs, Allowed resource type, Allowed locations, Allowed Virtual Machine
        SKUs, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assign a definition to a scope of resources. This specific scope could
        range from a management group to a resource group.
      </li>
      <li>
        Review the policy evaluation results - You can review the non-compliant
        policy results and take any action that is needed.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>policy initiatives</h3>

    <p>
      An initiative definition is a set of policy definitions to help track your
      compliance state for a larger goal. Initiative assignments reduce the need
      to make several initiative definitions for each scope.
    </p>

    <h2>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</h2>

    <p>
      Role-based access control provides fine-grained access management for
      Azure resources, enabling you to grant users only the rights they need to
      perform their jobs. RBAC is provided at no additional cost to all Azure
      subscribers.
    </p>

    <p>
      To view access permissions, access the Access Control (IAM) blade in the
      Azure portal. This blade, shows who has access to an area and their role.
      Using this same blade, you can also grant or remove access.
    </p>

        width="500px"
      />
    </a>

    <h3>Best practices</h3>
    <p>
      Using RBAC, segregate duties within your team and grant only the amount of
      access to users that they need to perform their jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When planning your access control strategy, grant users the lowest
      privilege level that they need to do their work.

    <h2>Resource locks</h2>

    <p>
      Resource locks help you prevent accidental deletion or modification of
      your Azure resources. You can manage these locks from within the Azure
      portal.
    </p>

    <p>

    <h2>Azure blueprints</h2>
    <p>
      Azure Blueprints enable cloud architects to define a repeatable set of
      Azure resources that implement and adhere to an organization's standards,
      patterns, and requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Azure Blueprint is a declarative way to orchestrate the deployment of
      various resource templates and other artifacts, such as: Role assignments,
      Policy assignments, Azure Resource Manager templates, Resource groups
    </p>

    <h3>Blueprint process</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Create an Azure Blueprint.</li>
      <li>Assign the blueprint.</li>
      <li>Track the blueprint assignments.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Azure Blueprints are different from Azure Resource Manager Templates. When
      Azure Resource Manager Templates deploy resources, they have no active
      relationship with the deployed resources (they exist in a local
      environment or in source control). By contrast, with Azure Blueprint, each
      deployment is tied to an Azure Blueprint package. This means that the
      relationship with resources will be maintained, even after deployment.
      Maintaining relationships, in this way, improves auditing and tracking
      capabilities.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Subscription governance</h2>

    <p>
      There are mainly three aspects to consider in relation to creating and
      managing subscriptions: Billing, Access Control, and Subscription limits.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Billing: Reports can be generated by subscriptions, if you have multiple
        internal departments and need to do "chargeback", a possible scenario is
        to create subscriptions by department or project.
      </li>
      <li>
        Access Control: A subscription is a deployment boundary for Azure
        resources and every subscription is associated with an Azure AD tenant
        that provides administrators the ability to set up role-based access
        control (RBAC).
      </li>
      <li>
        Subscription Limits: Subscriptions are also bound to some hard
        limitations.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h2>Azure Monitor</h2>
    <p>
      Azure Monitor maximizes the availability and performance of your
      applications by delivering a comprehensive solution for collecting,
      analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises
      environments. It helps you understand how your applications are performing
      and proactively identifies issues affecting them and the resources they
      depend on.

    <br />

    <h3>Diagnostic settings</h3>
    <p>
      As soon as you create an Azure subscription and start adding resources
      such as virtual machines and web apps, Azure Monitor starts collecting
      data.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Activity Logs record when resources are created or modified.</li>
      <li>
        Metrics tell you how the resource is performing and the resources that
        it's consuming.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Enabling diagnostics</h3>
    <p>Under the resource settings you can enable Diagnostics</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enable guest-level monitoring</li>
      <li>Performance counters: collect performance data</li>
      <li>Event Logs: enable various event logs</li>
      <li>Crash Dumps: enable or disable</li>

        service issue affects your resources. It provides you details with about
        the current and past state of your resources.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>Azure Monitor</h2>
    <p>
      Azure Monitor includes several features and tools that provide valuable
      insights into your applications, and the other resources they may depend
      on. Monitoring solutions and features, such as Application Insights and
      Container Insights, provide you with a deeper look into different aspects
      of your application and Azure services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Azure Monitor features can be organized into four categories, these
      categories are: Analyze, Respond, Visualize and Integrate.
    </p>

    <h3>Analyze</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Application Insights is a service that monitors the availability,
        performance, and usage of your web applications, whether they're hosted
        in the cloud or on-premises. Application Insights can diagnose errors,
        without waiting for a user to report them. Application Insights includes
        connection points to a variety of development tools and integrates with
        Microsoft Visual Studio to support your DevOps processes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Azure Monitor for containers is a service that is designed to monitor
        the performance of container workloads, which are deployed to managed
        Kubernetes clusters hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It gives
        you performance visibility by collecting memory and processor metrics
        from controllers, nodes, and containers, which are available in
        Kubernetes through the metrics API. Container logs are also collected.
      </li>
      <li>
        Azure Monitor for VMs includes support for monitoring performance and
        application dependencies for VMs hosted on-premises, and for VMs hosted
        with other cloud providers.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Respond</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Alerts. Azure Monitor proactively notifies you of critical conditions
        using Alerts and can potentially attempt to take corrective actions.
        Alert rules based on metrics can provide alerts in almost real-time,
        based on numeric values.
      </li>
      <li>
        Autoscale. Azure Monitor uses Autoscale to ensure that you have the
        right amount of resources running to manage the load on your application
        effectively. You can specify a minimum and maximum number of instances
        and provide the logic that determines when Autoscale should increase or
        decrease resources.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Visualize</h3>
    <p>
      Visualizations, such as charts and tables, are effective tools for
      summarizing monitoring data and for presenting data to different
      audiences.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dashboards</li>
      <li>Views</li>
      <li>Power BI</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Integrate</h3>
    <p>
      You'll often need to integrate Azure Monitor with other systems, and build
      customized solutions that use your monitoring data. Other Azure services
      can work with Azure Monitor to provide this integration.
    </p>

    <h2>Azure subscriptions</h2>
    <p>
      Using Azure requires an Azure subscription which provides you with
      authenticated and authorized access to Azure products and services and
      allows you to provision resources. An Azure subscription is a logical unit
      of Azure services that links to an Azure account, which is an identity in
      Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or in a directory that an Azure AD
      trusts.
    </p>

    <a href="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/subscriptions.png">
      <img
        src="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/subscriptions.png"
        width="400px"
      />
    </a>

    <p>
      An account can have one subscription or multiple subscriptions that have
      different billing models and to which you apply different
      access-management policies.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two types of subscription boundaries that you can use,
      including:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Billing boundary</b> - This subscription type determines how an Azure
        account is billed for using Azure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Access control boundary</b> - Azure will apply access-management
        policies at the subscription level, and you can create separate
        subscriptions to reflect different organizational structures.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Create additional Azure subscriptions</h3>
    <p>
      You might want to create additional subscriptions for resource or billing
      management purposes. For example, you might choose to create additional
      subscriptions to separate: Environments, Organizational structures,
      Billing, Subscription limits, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have multiple subscriptions, you can organize them into invoice
      sections. Each invoice section is a line item on the invoice that shows
      the charges incurred that month. For example, you might need a single
      invoice for your organization but want to organize charges by department,
      team, or project.
    </p>

      The following diagram shows an overview of how billing is structured. If
      you've previously signed up for Azure or if your organization has an
      Enterprise Agreement, your billing might be set up differently.

        and you’ll be billed at the standard pay-as-you-go rates.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Management groups</h3>
    <p>
      The organizing structure for resources in Azure has four levels:
      management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources. The
      following image shows the relationship of these levels i.e. the hierarchy
      of organization for the various objects
    </p>

    <a href="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/hierarchy.png">
      <img
        src="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/hierarchy.png"
        width="400px"
      />
    </a>

    <p>
      <b>Management groups</b><br />
      These are containers that help you manage access, policy, and compliance
      for multiple subscriptions.All subscriptions in a management group
      automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>10,000 management groups can be supported in a single directory.</li>
      <li>A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth.</li>
      <li>
        This limit doesn't include the Root level or the subscription level.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each management group and subscription can only support one parent.
      </li>
      <li>Each management group can have many children.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>Subscriptions</b><br />
      A subscription groups together user accounts and the resources that have
      been created by those user accounts. For each subscription, there are
      limits or quotas on the amount of resources you can create and use.
      Organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and the resources that
      are created by users, teams, or projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Resource groups</b><br />
      A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources like
      web apps, databases, and storage accounts are deployed and managed.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Resources</b><br />
      Resources are instances of services that you create, like virtual
      machines, storage, or SQL databases.
    </p>

        cloud services
      </li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>Purchase Azure products and services</h2>
    <p>
      There are three main customer types on which the available purchasing
      options for Azure products and services is contingent, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Enterprise</b><br />
        Enterprise customers sign an Enterprise Agreement with Azure that
        commits them to spending a negotiated amount on Azure services, which
        they typically pay annually.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Web direct</b><br />
        Web direct customers pay public prices for Azure resources, and their
        monthly billing and payments occur through the Azure website.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cloud Solution Provider</b><br />
        Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) typically are Microsoft partner companies
        that a customer hires to build solutions on top of Azure. Payment and
        billing for Azure usage occurs through the customer's CSP.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      At the end of each monthly billing cycle, the usage values will be charged
      to your payment method and the meters are reset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resources are always charged based on usage. For example, if you
      de-allocate a VM then you will not be billed for compute hours, I/O reads
      or writes or the private IP address since the VM is not running and has no
      allocated compute resources. However you will incur storage costs for the
      disks.
    </p>

    <h3>Factors affecting costs</h3>
    <p>
      When you provision an Azure resource, Azure creates one or more meter
      instances for that resource. The meters track the resources' usage, and
      each meter generates a usage record that is used to calculate your bill.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage meters</h3>
    <p>
      For example, a single virtual machine that you provision in Azure might
      have the following meters tracking its usage: Compute Hours, IP Address
      Hours, Data Transfer In, Data Transfer Out, Standard Managed Disk,
      Standard Managed Disk Operations, Standard IO-Disk, Standard IO-Block Blob
      Read, Standard IO-Block Blob Write, Standard IO-Block Blob Delete.
    </p>

    <h3>Resource type</h3>
    <p>
      Costs are resource-specific, so the usage that a meter tracks and the
      number of meters associated with a resource depend on the resource type.
    </p>

    <h3>Services</h3>
    <p>
      Azure usage rates and billing periods can differ between Enterprise, Web
      Direct, and Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) customers. Some subscription
      types also include usage allowances, which affect costs.
    </p>

    <h3>Location</h3>
    <p>
      The Azure infrastructure is globally distributed, and usage costs might
      vary between locations that offer Azure products, services, and resources.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Zones for billing purposes</h2>
    <p>
      Billing zones help determine the cost of services you are using. Bandwidth
      refers to data moving in and out of Azure datacenters. Some inbound data
      transfers, such as data going into Azure datacenters, are free. For
      outbound data transfers, such as data going out of Azure datacenters, data
      transfer pricing is based on Zones.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Zone is a geographical grouping of Azure Regions for billing purposes.
      the following Zones exist and include the sample regions as listed below:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Zone 1 – West US, East US, Canada West, West Europe, France Central and
        others
      </li>
      <li>
        Zone 2 – Australia Central, Japan West, Central India, Korea South and
        others
      </li>
      <li>Zone 3 - Brazil South</li>
      <li>DE Zone 1 - Germany Central, Germany Northeast</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>Pricing Calculator</h2>
    <p>
      The Pricing Calculator is a tool that helps you estimate the cost of Azure
      products.
    </p>
    <p>
      Get a new estimate from the Pricing Calculator by adding, removing, or
      reconfiguring your selected products. You also can access pricing details,
      product details, and documentation for each product from the Pricing
      Calculator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pricing Calculator provides estimates, not actual price quotes. Actual
      prices may vary depending upon the date of purchase, the payment currency
      you are using, and the type of Azure customer you are.
    </p>

        width="600px"
      />
    </a>

    <p>
      The options that you can configure in the Pricing Calculator vary between
      products, but basic configuration options include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Region</b> - Lists the regions from which you can provision a
        product. Southeast Asia, central Canada, the western United States, and

    <h2>Total Cost of Ownership Calculator</h2>
    <p>
      The Total Cost of Ownership Calculator is a tool that you use to estimate
      cost savings you can realize by migrating to Azure. To use the TCO
      calculator, complete the three steps that the following sections explain.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Step 1: Define your workloads</b> - Enter details about your
        on-premises infrastructure into the TCO calculator according to four

    <h2>Minimizing costs</h2>
    <p>
      The following best practice guidelines can help minimize your Azure costs.
    </p>

    <h3>Perform cost analyses</h3>
    <p>
      Plan your Azure solution wisely. Carefully consider the products,
      services, and resources you need, and read the relevant documentation to
      understand how each of your choices are metered and billed. Additionally,
      you should calculate your projected costs by using the Azure Pricing and
      Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculators, only adding the products,
      services, and resources you need.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an efficient architecture, provisioned resources match the demand for
      those resources. The Azure Advisor feature identifies unused or
      under-utilized resources, and you can implement its recommendations by
      removing unused resources and configuring your resources to match your
      actual demand.
    </p>

    <h3>Use spending limits</h3>
    <p>
      Free trial customers and some credit-based Azure subscriptions can use the
      Spending Limits feature. Azure provides the Spending Limits feature to
      help prevent you from exhausting the credit on your account within each
      billing period. If you have a credit-based subscription and you reach your
      configured spending limit, Azure suspends your subscription until a new
      billing period begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spending limit feature is not available for customers who aren't using
      credit-based subscriptions, such as Pay-As-You-Go subscribers. Note
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: Azure spending limits are not the same as Subscription, Service, or
      Resource Group limits and quotas.
    </p>

    <h3>Use Azure Reservations</h3>
    <p>
      Azure Reservations offer discounted prices on certain Azure products and
      resources. To get a discount, you reserve products and resources by paying
      in advance.
    </p>

    <h3>Choose low-cost locations and regions</h3>
    <p>
      The cost of Azure products, services, and resources can vary across
      locations and regions, and if possible, you should use them in those
      locations and regions where they cost less.
    </p>

    <h3>Research available cost-saving offers</h3>
    <p>
      Keep up-to-date with the latest Azure customer and subscription offers,
      and switch to offers that provide the greatest cost-saving benefit.
    </p>

    <h3>Apply tags to identify cost owners</h3>
    <p>
      Tags help you manage costs associated with the different groups of Azure
      products and resources. You can apply tags to groups of Azure products and
      resources to organize billing data.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Azure Cost Management</h2>
    <p>
      Cost Management is an Azure product that provides a set of tools for
      monitoring, allocating, and optimizing your Azure costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main features of the Azure Cost Management toolset include: Reporting
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Reporting. Generate reports using historical data to forecast future
        usage and expenditure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Data enrichment. Improve accountability by categorizing resources with
        tags that correspond to real-world business and organizational units.
      </li>
      <li>
        Budgets. Create and manage cost and usage budgets by monitoring resource
        demand trends, consumption rates, and cost patterns.
      </li>
      <li>Alerting. Get alerts based on your cost and usage budgets.</li>
      <li>
        Recommendations. Receive recommendations to eliminate idle resources and
        to optimize the Azure resources you provision.
      </li>
      <li>Price. Free to Azure customers.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>Service level agreements (SLAs)</h2>
    <p>
      SLAs describe Microsoft's commitment to providing Azure customers with
      certain performance standards. There are SLAs for individual Azure
      products and services. SLAs also specify what happens if a service or
      product fails to perform to a governing SLA's specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical SLA specifics performance-target commitments that range from
      99.9 percent ("three nines") to 99.99 percent ("four nines"), for each
      corresponding Azure product or service. These targets can apply to such
      performance criteria as uptime, or response times for services.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>SLA downtime estimates</h3>

    <table class="t1">

        <td>5.26 minutes</td>
      </tr>

    <h3>Service Credits</h3>
    <p>
      The first column in the table below shows monthly uptime percentage SLA
      targets for a single instance Azure Virtual Machine. The second column
      shows the corresponding service credit amount you receive, if the actual
      uptime is less than the specified SLA target for that month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Azure does not provide SLAs for many services under the Free or Shared
      tiers. Also, free products such as Azure Advisor do not typically have a
      SLA.
    </p>

    <table class="t1">
      <tr>
        <th>Monthly Uptime Percentage</th>
        <th>Service Credit Percentage</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>< 99.9</td>
        <td>10</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>< 99</td>
        <td>25</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>< 95</td>
        <td>100</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br />

    <h3>Composite SLA</h3>
    <p>
      When combining SLAs across different service offerings, the resultant SLA
      is a called a Composite SLA. The resulting composite SLA can provide
      higher or lower uptime values, depending on your application architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combined probability of failure value is lower than the individual SLA
      values. This isn't surprising, because an application that relies on
      multiple services has more potential failure points.
    </p>
    <code>99.95 percent × 99.99 percent = approx 99.94 percent </code>
    <p>
      Conversely, you can improve the composite SLA by creating independent
      fallback paths. For example, if SQL Database is unavailable, you can put
      transactions into a Queue for processing at a later time.
    </p>
    <code
      >Database *OR* Queue = 1.0 − (0.0001 × 0.001) = 99.99999 percent
    </code>
    <br />
    <br />

    <h3>Application SLA</h3>
    <p>
      Azure customers can use SLAs to evaluate how their Azure solutions meet
      their business requirements and the needs of their clients and users.
    </p>
    <p>
      When creating an Application SLA consider the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Identify workloads</b></li>
      <li>
        <b>Plan for usage patterns</b> during critical and non-critical periods
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Establish availability metrics</b> — mean time to recovery (MTTR) and
        mean time between failures (MTBF).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Establish recovery metrics</b> — recovery time objective and recovery
        point objective (RPO). RTO is the maximum acceptable time an application
        can be unavailable after an incident.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Implement resiliency strategies</b> - Resiliency is the ability of a
        system to recover from failures and continue to function. Implement
        resiliency design patterns, such as isolating critical resources, using
        compensating transactions, and performing asynchronous operations
        whenever possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Build availability requirements into your design</b> - Availability
        is the proportion of time your system is functional and working.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Resiliency</h3>
    <p>
      Resiliency is the ability of a system to recover from failures and
      continue to function. High availability and disaster recovery are two
      crucial components of resiliency.
    </p>
    <p>
      When designing your architecture you need to design for resiliency, and
      you should perform a Failure Mode Analysis (FMA).
    </p>

    <h3>Cost and complexity vs. high availability</h3>
    <p>
      Availability refers to the time that a system is functional and working.
      Maximizing availability requires implementing measures to prevent possible
      service failures. However, devising preventative measures can be difficult
      and expensive, and often results in complex solutions.

    <h2>Service lifecycle in Azure</h2>

    <p>
      Microsoft offers previews of Azure services, features, and functionality
      for evaluation purposes. With Azure Previews, you can test pre-release
      features, products, services, software, and even regions. Previews allow
      users early access to functionality. Additionally, users providing
      feedback on the preview features helps Microsoft improve the Azure
      service.
    </p>
    <p>There are two categories of preview that are available:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Preview feature</b> - An Azure feature is available to certain Azure
        customers for evaluation purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Public preview</b> - An Azure feature is available to all Azure
        customers for evaluation purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some preview features relate to a specific area of an existing Azure
        Service. The preview feature or functionality may not yet be ready for
        production deployments.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>Access Azure portal Preview</h3>
    <p>
      You can access preview features that are specific to the Azure portal from
      the https://preview.portal.azure.com page.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Provide feedback</h3>
    <p>
      Azure customers can provide feedback on the preview features they've
      tested by sending a smile in the portal. Or customers can post ideas and
      suggestions on the Azure portal feedback forum.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can submit your idea in Azure portal feedback forum at
      https://feedback.azure.com page.
