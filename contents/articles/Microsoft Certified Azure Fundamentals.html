    <h2>Cloud Concepts</h2>
    <p><a href="#TOP">[TOP]</a></p>

    <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>

    <p>
      Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services—servers, storage,
      databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence and more—over the
      internet (the cloud), enabling faster innovation, flexible resources, and
      economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use,
      helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more
      efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.
      <br />
      The company providing these services is referred to as a cloud provider.
      Some example providers are Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and
      the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
    </p>

    <h3>Key cloud concepts</h3>
    <p>
      Cloud services have characteristics and considerations, some of which are
      outlined and explained below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>High availability</b> - The ability to keep services up and running
        for long periods of time, with very little downtime.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Scalability</b> - The ability to increase or decrease resources for
        any given workload.
        <br />
        <b>Scaling out</b> - To add additional resources to service a workload
        <br />
        <b>Scaling up</b> - To add additional capabilities to manage an increase
        in demand to the existing resource. A distinction between scalability
        and elasticity is that elasticity is done automatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Elasticity</b> - The ability to automatically or dynamically increase
        or decrease resources as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Agility</b> - The ability to react quickly. Cloud services can
        allocate and deallocate resources quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Fault tolerance</b> - The ability to remain up and running even in
        the event of a component (or service) no longer functioning. Typically,
        redundancy is built into cloud services architecture, so if one
        component fails, a backup component takes its place. This type of
        service is said to be tolerant of faults.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Disaster recovery</b> - The ability to recover from an event which
        has taken down a cloud service. Cloud services disaster recovery can
        happen very quickly, with automation and services being readily
        available to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Global reach</b> - The ability to reach audiences around the globe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Customer latency capabilities</b> - Cloud services have the ability
        to deploy resources in datacenters around the globe, which addresses any
        customer latency issues.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Predictive cost considerations</b> - The ability for users to predict
        the costs they will incur for a particular cloud service.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Technical skill requirements and considerations</b> - Cloud services
        can provide and manage hardware and software for workloads. Getting a
        workload up and running with cloud services demands less technical
        resources than having IT teams build and maintain a physical
        infrastructure for handling the same workload.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Increased productivity</b> - On-site datacenters typically require a
        lot of hardware setup (otherwise known as racking and stacking),
        software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Security</b> Cloud providers offer a broad set of policies,
        technologies, controls, and expert technology skills that can provide
        better security than most organizations can otherwise achieve.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>CapEx vs OpEx</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Capital Expenditure (CapEx)</b> - This is the up front spending of
      money on physical infrastructure, and then deducting that up front expense
      over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Operational Expenditure (OpEx)</b> - This is spending money on services
      or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense
      in the same year you spend it. There is no up front cost, as you pay for a
      service or product as you use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, organizations can sign up for a service from a cloud provider to
      get up and running without the need for a significant investment into up
      front costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical on-premises datacenter includes costs such as: Server costs ,
      Storage costs, Network costs, Backup and archive costs, continuity and
      disaster recovery costs, datacenter infrastructure costs, Technical
      personnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Benefits of CapEx</b>
      <br />
      With capital expenditures, you plan your expenses at the start of a
      project or budget period.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Benefits of OpEx</b>
      <br />
      Demand and growth can be unpredictable and can outpace expectation, which
      is a challenge for the CapEx model as shown in the following graph. OpEx
      is particularly appealing if the demand fluctuates or to try a new product
      or service.

    <h3>Consumption-based models</h3>
    <p>
      Users only pay for the resources that they use. A consumption-based model
      has many benefits, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>No upfront costs.</li>
      <li>No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure.</li>
      <li>The ability to pay for additional resources when they are needed.</li>
      <li>
        The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of cloud models</h3>
    <p>There are three different cloud deployment models.</p>

    <h3>Public cloud</h3>
    <p>
      A public cloud is owned by the cloud services provider. Public cloud
      models have the following characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Ownership</b> - Resources are owned and operated by a third party,
        such as the cloud service provider.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Multiple end users</b> - Public cloud modes may make their resources
        available to multiple organizations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Public access</b> - Public access allows the public to access the
        desired cloud services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Availability</b> - Public cloud is the most common cloud-type
        deployment model.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Connectivity</b> - Users and organizations are typically connected to
        the public cloud over the internet using a web browser.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Skills</b> - Public clouds do not require deep technical knowledge to
        set up and use its resources.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Private cloud</h3>
    <p>
      A private cloud is owned and operated by the organization that uses the
      resources from that cloud. Private cloud models have the following
      characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Ownership</b> - The owner and user of the cloud services are the
        same.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Hardware</b> - The owner is entirely responsible for the purchase,
        maintenance, and management of the cloud hardware.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Users</b> - A private cloud operates only within one organization and
        cloud computing resources are used exclusively by a single business or
        organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Connectivity</b> - A connection to a private cloud is typically made
        over a private network that is highly secure.
      </li>
      <li><b>Public access</b> - Does not provide access to the public.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Skills</b> - Requires deep technical knowledge to set up, manage, and
        maintain.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div style="padding-top: 2em;"></div>
    <h2>Core Azure services</h2>
    <p><a href="#TOP">[TOP]</a></p>

    <p>Typically, cloud services include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Compute power</b> - such as Linux servers or web applications.</li>
      <li><b>Storage</b> - such as files and databases.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Networking</b> - such as secure connections between the cloud
        provider and your company.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Analytics</b> - such as visualizing telemetry and performance data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Compute power</h3>
    <p>
      Cloud-based servers that are processing each request and returning a
      response.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Virtual machine (VM)</b>
        <br />
        A VM is an emulation of a computer - just like your desktop or laptop
        you're using now. Each VM includes an operating system and hardware that
        appears to the user like a physical computer running Windows or Linux.
        You can then install whatever software you need to do the tasks you want
        to run in the cloud.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Containers</b>
        <br />
        Containers provide a consistent, isolated execution environment for
        applications. They're similar to VMs except they don't require a guest
        operating system. Instead, the application and all its dependencies is
        packaged into a "container" and then a standard runtime environment is
        used to execute the app. The open-source project, Docker, is one of the
        leading platforms for managing containers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Serverless computing</b>
        <br />
        Serverless computing lets you run application code without creating,
        configuring, or maintaining a server. The core idea is that your
        application is broken into separate functions that run when triggered by
        some action. This is ideal for automated tasks - for example, you can
        build a serverless process that automatically sends an email
        confirmation after a customer makes an online purchase.
      </li>
    </ul>

      />
    </a>

    <h3>Storage</h3>
    <p>
      Cloud providers typically offer storage services that can handle all of
      these types of data.The advantage to using cloud-based data storage is you
      can scale to meet your needs. In some cases, the storage can even expand
      and contract automatically.
