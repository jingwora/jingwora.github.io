    <h2>Cloud Concepts</h2>
    <p><a href="#TOP">[TOP]</a></p>

    <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>

    <p>
      Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services—servers, storage,
      databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence and more—over the
      internet (the cloud), enabling faster innovation, flexible resources, and
      economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use,
      helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more
      efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.
      <br />
      The company providing these services is referred to as a cloud provider.
      Some example providers are Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and
      the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
    </p>

    <h3>Key cloud concepts</h3>
    <p>
      Cloud services have characteristics and considerations, some of which are
      outlined and explained below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>High availability</b> - The ability to keep services up and running
        for long periods of time, with very little downtime.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Scalability</b> - The ability to increase or decrease resources for
        any given workload.
        <br />
        <b>Scaling out</b> - To add additional resources to service a workload
        <br />
        <b>Scaling up</b> - To add additional capabilities to manage an increase
        in demand to the existing resource. A distinction between scalability
        and elasticity is that elasticity is done automatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Elasticity</b> - The ability to automatically or dynamically increase
        or decrease resources as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Agility</b> - The ability to react quickly. Cloud services can
        allocate and deallocate resources quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Fault tolerance</b> - The ability to remain up and running even in
        the event of a component (or service) no longer functioning. Typically,
        redundancy is built into cloud services architecture, so if one
        component fails, a backup component takes its place. This type of
        service is said to be tolerant of faults.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Disaster recovery</b> - The ability to recover from an event which
        has taken down a cloud service. Cloud services disaster recovery can
        happen very quickly, with automation and services being readily
        available to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Global reach</b> - The ability to reach audiences around the globe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Customer latency capabilities</b> - Cloud services have the ability
        to deploy resources in datacenters around the globe, which addresses any
        customer latency issues.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Predictive cost considerations</b> - The ability for users to predict
        the costs they will incur for a particular cloud service.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Technical skill requirements and considerations</b> - Cloud services
        can provide and manage hardware and software for workloads. Getting a
        workload up and running with cloud services demands less technical
        resources than having IT teams build and maintain a physical
        infrastructure for handling the same workload.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Increased productivity</b> - On-site datacenters typically require a
        lot of hardware setup (otherwise known as racking and stacking),
        software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Security</b> Cloud providers offer a broad set of policies,
        technologies, controls, and expert technology skills that can provide
        better security than most organizations can otherwise achieve.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h3>CapEx vs OpEx</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Capital Expenditure (CapEx)</b> - This is the up front spending of
      money on physical infrastructure, and then deducting that up front expense
      over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Operational Expenditure (OpEx)</b> - This is spending money on services
      or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense
      in the same year you spend it. There is no up front cost, as you pay for a
      service or product as you use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, organizations can sign up for a service from a cloud provider to
      get up and running without the need for a significant investment into up
      front costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical on-premises datacenter includes costs such as: Server costs ,
      Storage costs, Network costs, Backup and archive costs, continuity and
      disaster recovery costs, datacenter infrastructure costs, Technical
      personnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Benefits of CapEx</b>
      <br />
      With capital expenditures, you plan your expenses at the start of a
      project or budget period.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Benefits of OpEx</b>
      <br />
      Demand and growth can be unpredictable and can outpace expectation, which
      is a challenge for the CapEx model as shown in the following graph. OpEx
      is particularly appealing if the demand fluctuates or to try a new product
      or service.

    </a>

    <h3>Consumption-based models</h3>
    <p>
      Users only pay for the resources that they use. A consumption-based model
      has many benefits, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>No upfront costs.</li>
      <li>No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure.</li>
      <li>The ability to pay for additional resources when they are needed.</li>
      <li>
        The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h3>Types of cloud models</h3>
    <p>There are three different cloud deployment models.</p>

    <h3>Public cloud</h3>
    <p>
      A public cloud is owned by the cloud services provider. This is the most
      common deployment model. Public cloud models have the following
      characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Ownership</b> - Resources are owned and operated by a third party,
        such as the cloud service provider.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Multiple end users</b> - Public cloud modes may make their resources
        available to multiple organizations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Public access</b> - Public access allows the public to access the
        desired cloud services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Availability</b> - Public cloud is the most common cloud-type
        deployment model.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Connectivity</b> - Users and organizations are typically connected to
        the public cloud over the internet using a web browser.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Skills</b> - Public clouds do not require deep technical knowledge to
        set up and use its resources.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Advantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>No CapEx</li>
      <li>Agility - deprovisioned whenever needed.</li>
      <li>Consumption-based model</li>
      <li>No responsibility for hardware maintenance or updates.</li>
      <li>
        No deep technical skills are required to deploy, use, and gain the
        benefits of a public cloud./li>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Disadvantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Security - There may be specific security requirements.</li>
      <li>
        Compliance - There may be government policies, industry standards, or
        legal requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ownership - Organizations don't own the hardware or services and cannot
        manage them as they may wish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Specific scenarios - If organizations have a unique business requirement
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Private cloud</h3>
    <p>
      A private cloud is owned and operated by the organization that uses the
      resources from that cloud. Private cloud models have the following
      characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Ownership</b> - The owner and user of the cloud services are the
        same.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Hardware</b> - The owner is entirely responsible for the purchase,
        maintenance, and management of the cloud hardware.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Users</b> - A private cloud operates only within one organization and
        cloud computing resources are used exclusively by a single business or
        organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Connectivity</b> - A connection to a private cloud is typically made
        over a private network that is highly secure.
      </li>
      <li><b>Public access</b> - Does not provide access to the public.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Skills</b> - Requires deep technical knowledge to set up, manage, and
        maintain.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A use case scenario for a private cloud are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Legal reasons. For example, they may have medical data that cannot be
        exposed publicly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Government policy requires specific data to be kept in-country or
        privately.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Advantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Control - Organizations have complete control over the resources.</li>
      <li>Security - Organizations have complete control over security.</li>
      <li>
        Compliance - If organizations have very strict security, compliance, or
        legal requirements.
      </li>
      <li>Specific scenarios</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Disadvantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Upfront CapEx</li>
      <li>Not as agile as public clouds</li>
      <li>
        Maintenance - Organizations have the responsibility for hardware
        maintenance and updates.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skills - Private clouds require in-house IT skills and expertise that
        may be hard to get or be costly.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hybrid cloud</h3>
    <p>
      A hybrid cloud combines both public and private clouds, allowing you to
      run your applications in the most appropriate location. Hybrid cloud
      models have the following characteristics:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Resource location</b> - Specific resources run or are used in a
        public cloud, and others run or are used in a private cloud.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cost and efficiency. Hybrid cloud models allow an organization to
        leverage some of the benefits of cost, efficiency, and scale that are
        available with a public cloud model.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Control</b> - Organizations retain management control in private
        clouds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Skills</b> - Technical skills are still required to maintain the
        private cloud and ensure both cloud models can operate together.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Advantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Flexibility to use private cloud or in a public cloud.</li>
      <li>
        Costs - Organizations can take advantage of economies of scale from
        public cloud providers for services and resources as they wish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Control - Organizations can still access resources over which they have
        total control.
      </li>
      <li>
        Security - Organizations can still access resources for which they are
        responsible for security.
      </li>
      <li>Compliance - maintain compliance, or legal requirements.</li>
      <li>Specific scenarios</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Disadvantages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Upfront CapEx for private cloud.</li>
      <li>Costs - Purchasing and maintaining a private cloud.</li>
      <li>
        Skills - Deep technical skills are still required to be able to set up a
        private cloud.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ease of management - Organizations need to ensure there are clear
        guidelines to avoid confusion, complications or misuse.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h3>Types of cloud services</h3>
    <p>
      When talking about cloud computing services, there are three major
      categories: IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Shared responsibility model</b>
      <br />
      Depending on the service you are using, the cloud provider is responsible
      for some aspects of the workload management, and the customer or end user
      is responsible for other aspects of the workload management, and in some
      cases, both share a responsibility.
    </p>
    <a
      href="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/shared-responsibility.png"
    >
      <img
        src="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/shared-responsibility.png"
        width="700px"
      />
    </a>
    <ul>
      <li>
        IaaS requires the most user management of all the cloud services. The
        user is responsible for managing the operating systems, data, and
        applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        PaaS requires less user management. The cloud provider manages the
        operating systems, and the user is responsible for the applications and
        data they run and store.
      </li>
      <li>
        SaaS requires the least amount of management. The cloud provider is
        responsible for managing everything, and the end user just uses the
        software.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h3>
    <p>
      Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the most basic category of cloud
      computing services. You rent IT infrastructure servers and virtual
      machines (VMs), storage, networks, and operating systems from a cloud
      provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.
    </p>

    <p><b>IaaS characteristics </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Upfront costs. IaaS has no upfront costs. Users pay only for what they
        consume.
      </li>
      <li>
        User ownership. The user is responsible for the purchase, installation,
        configuration, and management of their own software operating systems,
        middleware, and applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cloud provider ownership. The cloud provider is responsible for ensuring
        that the underlying cloud infrastructure is available for the user.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Common IaaS usage scenarios</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Migrating workloads</li>
      <li>
        Test and development. Teams can quickly set up and dismantle test and
        development environments, bringing new applications to market faster.
      </li>
      <li>
        Website hosting. Running websites using IaaS can be less expensive than
        traditional web hosting.
      </li>
      <li>Storage, backup, and recovery</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Advantages </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No CapEx. Users have no upfront costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Agility. Applications can be made accessible quickly, and deprovisioned
        whenever needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consumption-based model
      </li>
      <li>
        Skills. No deep technical skills are required to deploy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cloud benefits. Organizations can leverage the skills and expertise of
        the cloud provider.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flexibility: IaaS is the most flexible cloud service.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Disadvantages</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Management. The shared responsibility model applies; the user manages
        and maintains the services they have provisioned, and the cloud provider
        manages and maintains the cloud infrastructure.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3>
    <p>
      Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides an environment for building,
      testing, and deploying software applications.
    </p>

    <p><b>PaaS characteristics </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Upfront costs. There are no upfront costs, and users pay only for what
        they consume.
      </li>
      <li>
        User ownership. The user is responsible for the development of their own
        applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cloud provider ownership. The cloud provider is responsible for
        operating system management, and network and service configuration.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Common PaaS usage scenarios </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Development framework. PaaS provides a framework that developers can
        build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Analytics or business intelligence. Tools provided as a service with
        PaaS allow organizations to analyze and mine their data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Advantages </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No CapEx. Users have no upfront costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Agility. PaaS is more agile than IaaS.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consumption-based model. Users pay only for what they use, and operate
        on an OpEx model.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skills. No deep technical skills are required to deploy, use, and gain
        the benefits of PaaS.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cloud benefits. Users can leverage the skills and expertise of the cloud
        provider.
      </li>
      <li>
        Productivity. Users can focus on application development only.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Disadvantages</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Platform limitations. There may be some limitations to a cloud platform
        that could affect how an application runs.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h3>
    <p>
      Software as a Service (SaaS) is software that is centrally hosted and
      managed for the end customer. It allows users to connect to and use
      cloud-based apps over the internet.
    </p>

    <p><b>SaaS characteristics </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Upfront costs. Users have no upfront costs; they pay a subscription,
        typically on a monthly or annual basis.
      </li>
      <li>
        User ownership. Users just use the application software.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cloud provider ownership. The cloud provider is responsible for the
        provision, management, and maintenance of the application software.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Common SaaS usage scenarios </b></p>
    <p>
      Common examples are email, calendars, and office tools such as Microsoft
      Office 365.
    </p>

    <p><b>Advantages </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No CapEx. Users don’t have any upfront costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Agility. Users can provide staff with access to the latest software
        quickly and easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pay-as-you-go pricing model: Users pay for the software they use on a
        subscription model, typically monthly or yearly, regardless of how much
        they use the software.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flexibility. Users can access the same application data from anywhere.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Disadvantages</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Software limitations. There may be some limitations to a software
        application that might affect how users work.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Core Azure architectural components</h3>

    <h3>Regions</h3>
    <p>
      A region is a geographical area on the planet containing at least one, but
      potentially multiple datacenters that are in close proximity and networked
      together with a low-latency network. A few examples of regions are West
      US, Canada Central, West Europe, Australia East, and Japan West. At the
      time of writing this, Azure is generally available in 55 regions and
      available in 140 countries.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Azure has more global regions than any other cloud provider.</li>
      <li>
        Regions provide customers the flexibility and scale needed to bring
        applications closer to their users.
      </li>
      <li>
        Regions preserve data residency and offer comprehensive compliance and
        resiliency options for customers.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Special Azure regions </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more: These are
        physical and logical network-isolated instances of Azure for US
        government agencies and partners.
      </li>
      <li>
        China East, China North and more: These regions are available through a
        unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, whereby Microsoft
        does not directly maintain the datacenters.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Region Pairs</h3>
    <p>
      Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography
      (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away, which together make
      a region pair.
    </p>
    <a href="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/regional-pairs.png">
      <img
        src="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/regional-pairs.png"
        width="400px"
      />
    </a>
    <p><b>Benefits</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Physical isolation - Physical datacenter separation reduces the
        likelihood of natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or
        physical network outages affecting both regions at once.
      </li>
      <li>Platform-provided replication</li>
      <li>Region recovery order</li>
      <li>Sequential updates</li>
      <li></li>
      <li>Planned Azure updates</li>
      <li>Tax and law enforcement jurisdiction purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Geographies</h3>
    <p>
      Azure divides the world into geographies that are defined by geopolitical
      boundaries or country borders. An Azure geography is a discrete market
      typically containing two or more regions that preserves data residency and
      compliance boundaries.
    </p>

    <p><b>Benefits</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Geographies allow customers with specific data residency and compliance
        needs to keep their data and applications close.
      </li>
      <li>
        Geographies ensure that data residency, sovereignty, compliance, and
        resiliency requirements are honored within geographical boundaries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Geographies are fault-tolerant to withstand complete region failure
        through their connection to dedicated high-capacity networking
        infrastructure.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Geographies are broken up into the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Americas</li>
      <li>Europe</li>
      <li>Asia Pacific</li>
      <li>Middle East and Africa</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Availability Options</h3>

    <a href="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/availability-options.png">
      <img
        src="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/availability-options.png"
      />
    </a>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A single virtual machine with premium storage has an SLA of 99.9%.
      </li>
      <li>
        By placing virtual machines in an availability set, you protect against
        datacenter failures and increases the SLA to 99.95%.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adding virtual machines to availability zones protects from entire
        datacenter failures and increases the SLA to 99.99%, which is highest
        level of protection that is provided.
      </li>
      <li>
        For multi-region disaster recovery, region pairs protect and provide
        data residency boundaries.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Availability sets</h3>
    <p>
      Availability sets are a way for you to ensure your application remains
      online if a high-impact maintenance event is required, or if a hardware
      failure occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Availability sets are made up of Update domains (UD) and Fault domains
      (FD).
      <br />
      <b>Update domains</b> - When a maintenance event occurs.
      <br />
      <b>Fault domains</b>
      provide for the physical separation of your workload across different
      hardware in the datacenter.
    </p>
    <h3>Availability Zones</h3>
    <p>
      Availability zones are physically separate locations within an Azure
      region that use availability sets to provide additional fault tolerance.
      The availability zones are typically connected to each other through very
      fast, private fiber-optic networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can co-locating your compute, storage, networking, and data resources
      within a zone and replicating in other zones.
      <br />
      Zonal services – you pin the resource to a specific zone
      <br />
      Zone-redundant services – platform replicates automatically across zones
    </p>

    <hr />
    <h3>Resource groups</h3>
    <p>
      A resource group is a unit of management for your resources in Azure. You
      can manage and apply the following resources at resource group level:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><Metering and billing /li></li>
      <li>Policies</li>
      <li>Monitoring and alerts</li>
      <li>Quotas</li>
      <li>Access control</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Remember that when you delete a resource group you delete all resources
      contained within it.
    </p>

    <p><b>Considerations </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each resource must exist in one, and only one, resource group.</li>
      <li>
        A resource group can contain resources that reside in different regions.
      </li>
      <li>You can add or remove a resource to a resource group at any time.</li>
      <li>You can move a resource from one resource group to another.</li>
      <li>
        It is recommended that you keep an application in the same resource
        group for ease of management.
      </li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Logical grouping </b></p>
    <p>
      By placing resources of similar usage, type, or location, you can provide
      some order and organization to resources you create in Azure.
    </p>

    <p><b>Life cycle </b></p>
    <p>
      Resource groups make it easy to remove a set of resources at once which
      can be useful in non-production environments.
    </p>

    <p><b>Authorization </b></p>
    <p>
      Resource groups are also a scope for applying role-based access control
      (RBAC) permissions.
    </p>

    <p><b>Create a resource group </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Azure portal</li>
      <li>Azure PowerShell</li>
      <li>Azure CLI</li>
      <li>Templates</li>
      <li>Azure SDKs (like .NET, Java)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Guidelines</h3>
    <p>Consistent naming convention</p>
    <p>Resource groups can be organized in a number of ways.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>By resource type - vnet-rg, vm-rg, db-rg</li>
      <li>By environment - dev-rg, prod-rg, qa-rg</li>
      <li>By department - finance-rg, marketing-rg, hr-rg</li>
      <li>
        Combination of these strategies and organize by environment and
        department - prod-finance-rg, dev-finance-rg
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Azure Resource Manager</h3>
    <p>
      Azure Resource Manager is a management layer in which resource groups and
      all the resources within it are created, configured, managed, and deleted.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Deploy Application resources
      </li>
      <li>
        Organize resources
      </li>
      <li>Control access and resources</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Core Azure services</h2>
    <p><a href="#TOP">[TOP]</a></p>

    <p>
      <b>Azure compute</b> is an on-demand computing service for running
      cloud-based applications. It provides computing resources such as disks,
      processors, memory, networking and operating systems.Typically, cloud
      services include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Compute power</b> - such as Linux servers or web applications.</li>
      <li><b>Storage</b> - such as files and databases.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Networking</b> - such as secure connections between the cloud
        provider and your company.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Analytics</b> - such as visualizing telemetry and performance data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>Compute power</h2>
    <p>
      Cloud-based servers that are processing each request and returning a
      response. Some of common compute powers are VM, Containers and Serverless.
    </p>

    >
      <img
        src="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/2-virtual-machine-versus-container-versus-serverless.png"
      />
    </a>

    <h3>Virtual machine (VM)</h3>
    <p>
      A VM is an emulation of a computer - just like your desktop or laptop
      you're using now. Each VM includes an operating system and hardware that
      appears to the user like a physical computer running Windows or Linux. You
      can then install whatever software you need to do the tasks you want to
      run in the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Azure supports a wide range of computing solutions for development and
      testing, running applications, and extending your datacenter, including
      Linux, Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM, and SAP.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Virtual machine scale sets </b>
      <br />
      Virtual machine scale sets are an Azure compute resource that you can use
      to deploy and manage a set of identical VMs to support true autoscale and
      containerized workloads.
    </p>

        target="_blank"
        >Link</a
      >
    </p>

    <h3>Container services</h3>
    <p>
      Containers provide a consistent, isolated execution environment for
      applications. They're similar to VMs except they don't require a guest
      operating system. Instead, the application and all its dependencies is
      packaged into a "container" and then a standard runtime environment is
      used to execute the app. The open-source project, Docker, is one of the
      leading platforms for managing containers. VM virtualises machine,
      container virtualises OS.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two ways to manage both Docker and Microsoft-based containers in
      Azure.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Azure Container Instances</b> offers the fastest and simplest way to
        run a container in Azure without having to manage any virtual machines
        or adopt any additional services. It is a PaaS offering that allows you
        to upload your containers, which it will run for you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</b> is a complete orchestration
        service for containers with distributed architectures and large volumes
        of containers. Orchestration is the task of automating and managing a
        large number of containers and how they interact.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Microservice architecture</h3>
    <p>
      This architecture is where you break solutions into smaller, independent
      pieces. For example, you may split a website into a container hosting your
      front end, another hosting your back end, and a third for storage. This
      split allows you to separate portions of your app into logical sections
      that can be maintained, scaled, or updated independently.
    </p>

    <h3>Migrate apps to containers</h3>

    <a

    >
      <img
        src="./Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals/4-kubernetes-migration.png"
      />
    </a>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You convert an existing application to one or more containers and then
        publish one or more container images to the Azure Container Registry.
      </li>
      <li>
        By using the Azure portal or the command line, you deploy the containers
        to an AKS cluster.
      </li>
      <li>Azure AD controls access to AKS resources.</li>
      <li>
        You access SLA-backed Azure services, such as Azure Database for MySQL,
        via OSBA.
      </li>
      <li>Optionally, AKS is deployed with a virtual network.</li>
    </ul>

      </a>
    </p>

    <h3>Serverless computing</h3>
    <p>
      Serverless computing lets you run application code without creating,
      configuring, or maintaining a server. The core idea is that your
      application is broken into separate functions that run when triggered by
      some action. This is ideal for automated tasks - for example, you can
      build a serverless process that automatically sends an email confirmation
      after a customer makes an online purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      An event could be a REST endpoint, a periodic timer, or even a message
      received from another Azure service.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Azure Functions </b>
      <br />
      Azure Functions are ideal when you're concerned only about the code
      running your service and not the underlying platform or infrastructure.
      Azure Functions are commonly used when you need to perform work in
      response to an event—often via a REST request, timer, or message from
      another Azure service—and when that work can be completed quickly, within
      seconds or less.
      <br />
      Azure Functions scale automatically, and charges accrue only when a
      function is triggered, so they're a solid choice when demand is variable.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Azure Logic Apps </b>
      <br />
      Logic Apps is a cloud service that helps you automate and orchestrate
      tasks, business processes, and workflows when you need to integrate apps,
      data, systems, and services across enterprises or organizations.
      <br />
      Logic Apps are designed in a web-based designer and can execute logic
      triggered by Azure services without writing any code.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Azure Event Grid </b>
      <br />
      Event Grid allows you to easily build applications with event-based
      architectures. It's a fully managed, intelligent event routing service
      that uses a publish-subscribe model for uniform event consumption.
      <br />
      You can use Event Grid to support your own non-Azure-based events in
      near-real time, using custom topics. You can use filters to route specific
      events to different endpoints, and ensure your events are reliably
      delivered.

    <hr />

    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Cloud providers typically offer storage services that can handle all of
      these types of data.The advantage to using cloud-based data storage is you
      can scale to meet your needs. In some cases, the storage can even expand
      and contract automatically.
    </p>

    <h3>Azure data categories</h3>
    <p>
      You can generally think of data as structured, semi-structured, and
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Structured data </b>
      <br />
      Structured data is also known as relational data. The data's schema
      defines the table of data, the fields in the table, and the clear
      relationship between the two. Structured data can be stored in a database
      table with rows and columns. Structured data is easy to enter, query, and
      analyze because all the data follows the same format.
      <br /><b>Examples</b> of structured data include sensor data or financial
      data.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Structured data </b>
      <br />
      Semi-structured data is also known as non-relational or NoSQL data.
      Semi-structured data is less organized than structured data.
      Semi-structured data is not stored in a relational format, meaning the
      fields do not neatly fit into tables, rows, and columns. Semi-structured
      data contains tags that make the organization and hierarchy of the data
      apparent.
      <br />
      <b>Examples</b> of semi-structured data include books, blogs, and HTML
      documents.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Unstructured data </b>
      <br />
      Unstructured data has no designated structure. Unstructured data can hold
      any kind of data. Unstructured data is becoming more prominent as
      businesses try to tap into new data sources.

      <b>Examples</b> Examples of unstructured data include a PDF document, a
      JPG image, a JSON file, and video content.

    <h2>Azure Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Azure Storage is a service that you can use to store files, messages,
      tables, and other types of information. Azure Storage is also used by IaaS
      virtual machines, and PaaS cloud services. Some of the most common storage
      service types in Azure are disks, files, objects, queues, and tables.
    </p>

    <h3>Disk storage</h3>
    <p>
      Disk storage provides disks for virtual machines, applications, and other
      services to access and use as they need, similar to how they would in
      on-premises scenarios. Disks come in many different sizes and performance
      levels, from solid-state drives (SSDs) to traditional spinning hard disk
      drives (HDDs), with varying performance abilities.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Containers (Blobs)</h3>
    <p>
      Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud.
      Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured
      data, such as text or binary data.
    </p>
    <p>Blob storage is ideal for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Serving images or documents directly to a browser.</li>
      <li>Storing files for distributed access.</li>
      <li>Streaming video and audio.</li>
      <li>
        Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>Files</h3>
    <p>
      Azure Files enables you to set up highly available network file shares
      that can be accessed by using the standard Server Message Block (SMB)
      protocol. That means that multiple VMs can share the same files with both
      read and write access. You can also read the files using the REST
      interface or the storage client libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing that distinguishes Azure Files from files on a corporate file
      share is that you can access the files from anywhere in the world using a
      URL that points to the file and includes a shared access signature (SAS)
      token.
    </p>
    <p>File shares can be used for many common scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Many on-premises applications use file shares. This feature makes it
        easier to migrate those applications that share data to Azure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Configuration files can be stored on a file share and accessed from
        multiple VMs. Tools and utilities used by multiple developers in a group
        can be stored on a file share, ensuring that everybody can find them,
        and that they use the same version.
      </li>
      <li>
        Diagnostic logs, metrics, and crash dumps are just three examples of
        data that can be written to a file share and processed or analyzed
        later.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>Queues</h3>
    <p>
      The Azure Queue service is used to store and retrieve messages. Queue
      messages can be up to 64 KB in size, and a queue can contain millions of
      messages. Queues are generally used to store lists of messages to be
      processed asynchronously.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, say you want your customers to be able to upload pictures,
      and you want to create thumbnails for each picture. When the customer
      finishes their upload, write a message to the queue. Then have an Azure
      Function retrieve the message from the queue and create the thumbnails.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Tables</h3>
    <p>
      Azure Table storage stores large amounts of structured data. The service
      is a NoSQL datastore which accepts authenticated calls from inside and
      outside the Azure cloud. Azure tables are ideal for storing structured,
      non-relational data. Common uses of Table storage include:
    </p>
    <p>Common uses of Table storage include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Storing TBs of structured data capable of serving web scale
        applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Storing datasets that don't require complex joins, foreign keys, or
        stored procedures and can be denormalized for fast access.
      </li>
      <li>Quickly querying data using a clustered index.</li>
    </ul>
