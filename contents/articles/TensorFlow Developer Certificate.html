    <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Artificial Intelligence:</b> A field of computer science that aims to
      make computers achieve human-style intelligence. There are many approaches

    <h1>Types of Machine Learning</h1>

    <h2>Supervised Learning</h2>
    <p>
      In supervised learning, the machine uses labeled training data. It is told
      the correct output and it compares its own output which informs the
      subsequent steps, adjusting itself along the way.
    </p>

    <p>The Supervised Learning mainly divided into two parts:</p>

    <h3>Regression</h3>
    <p>A machine learning model used to predict continuous value.</p>

    <p>
      <b>Regression algorithms</b> - predict one or more continuous numeric
      variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Association algorithms</b>
      - find correlations between different attributes in a dataset. The most
      common application of this kind of algorithm is for creating association
      rules, which can be used in a market basket analysis.
    </p>

    <h3>Classification</h3>
    <p>
      A machine learning model used for distinguishing among two or more output
      categories.
    </p>

    <h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2>
    <p>
      In unsupervised learning, the data isn't labeled. The machine must figure
      out the correct answer without being told and must therefore discover
      unknown patterns in the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some popular examples of unsupervised learning include GANs and
      Autoencoders.
    </p>
    <p>The Unsupervised Learning mainly divided into two parts:</p>

    <h3>Clustering</h3>
    <p>
      Clustering is a Machine Learning technique that involves the grouping of
      data points. Given a set of data points, we can use a clustering algorithm
      to classify each data point into a specific group.
    </p>

    <h3>Dimensionality Reduction</h3>
    <p>
      Machine Learning technique reduces the dimensionality of training data.
      The module analyzes input data and creates a reduced feature set that
      captures all the information contained in the dataset, but in a smaller
      number of features.
    </p>

    <h2>Semi-Supervised Learning</h2>
    <p>
      In Semi-Supervised Learning: Input data is a mixture of labeled and
      unlabeled examples.
    </p>

    <h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
    <p>
      Reinforcement Learning allows the machine the most freedom. It uses trial
      and error to discover the actions that yield the greatest rewards. AlphaGo
      is a famous example of RL.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <br />

    <h3>Machine learning vs Traditional programming</h3>
    <p>
      Traditional programming languages typically take data and rules as input
      and apply the rules to the data in order to come up with answers as
      output.
      <br />
      On the other hand, in machine learning paradigm the data and answers (or
      labels) go in as input and the learned rules (models) come out as output.
      Machine learning paradigm is uniquely valuable because it lets computer to
      learn new rules in complex and high dimensional space, a space harder to
      comprehend by humans.

    <h3>The Training Process</h3>
    <p>
      The training process (happening in model.fit(...)) is really about tuning
      the internal variables of the networks to the best possible values, so
      that they can map the input to the output. This is achieved through an
      optimization process called Gradient Descent, which uses Numeric Analysis
      to find the best possible values to the internal variables of the model.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Gradient descent</b> iteratively adjusts parameters, nudging them in
      the correct direction a bit at a time until they reach the best values. In
      this case “best values” means that nudging them any more would make the
      model perform worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The function that measures how good or bad the model is during each
      iteration is called the <b>“loss function”</b>, and the goal of each nudge
      is to “minimize the loss function.
    </p>

    <p>
      The training process starts with a forward pass, where the input data is
      fed to the neural network (see Fig.1). Then the model applies its internal
      math on the input and internal variables to predict an answer ("Model
      Predicts a Value" in Fig. 1). In our example, the input was the degrees in
      Celsius, and the model predicted the corresponding degrees in Fahrenheit.
    </p>

    <a href="./TensorFlow Developer Certificate/img/tensorflow-l2f2.png">
      <img
        src="./TensorFlow Developer Certificate/img/tensorflow-l2f2.png"
        width="700"
      />
    </a>

    <p>
      Once a value is predicted, the difference between that predicted value and
      the correct value is calculated. This difference is called the loss, and
      it's a measure of how well the model performed the mapping task. The value
      of the loss is calculated using a loss function, which we specified with
      the loss parameter when calling model.compile().
    </p>

    <p>
      After the loss is calculated, the internal variables (weights and biases)
      of all the layers of the neural network are adjusted, so as to minimize
      this loss — that is, to make the output value closer to the correct value
      (see Fig. 2).
    </p>

        src="./TensorFlow Developer Certificate/img/tensorflow-l2f3.png"
        width="700"
      />
    </a>

    <p>
      This optimization process is called Gradient Descent. The specific
      algorithm used to calculate the new value of each internal variable is
      specified by the optimizer parameter when calling model.compile(...). In
      this example we used the Adam optimizer.

    <h3>Key Machine Learning Terminology</h3>

    <p><b>Feature</b> - The input(s) to our model.</p>

    <p><b>Labels</b> - The output our model predicts.</p>

    <p>
      <b>Examples</b> - An input/output pair used for training. We break
      examples into two categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Labeled example includes both feature(s) and the label.
        <br />
        <code>labeled examples: {features, label}: (x, y) </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Unlabeled example contains features but not the label.
        <br />
        <code>unlabeled examples: {features, ?}: (x, ?) </code>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>Model</b> - A model defines the relationship between features and
      label.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Training</b> - Training means creating or learning the model. That is,
      you show the model labeled examples and enable the model to gradually
      learn the relationships between features and label.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Inference</b> - Inference means applying the trained model to unlabeled
      examples. That is, you use the trained model to make useful predictions
      (y').
    </p>

    <br />

    <h3>Key Neural Network Terminology</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Layer</b> - A collection of nodes connected together within a neural
      network.
    </p>
    <p><b>Weights and biases</b> - The internal variables of model.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Loss</b> - The discrepancy between the desired output and the actual
      output
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Gradient Descent</b> - An algorithm that changes the internal variables
      a bit at a time to gradually reduce the loss function.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)</b> - uses only a single example (a
      batch size of 1) per iteration. Given enough iterations, SGD works but is
      very noisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (mini-batch SGD)</b> - is a
      compromise between full-batch iteration and SGD. A mini-batch is typically
      between 10 and 1,000 examples, chosen at random. Mini-batch SGD reduces
      the amount of noise in SGD but is still more efficient than full-batch.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Optimizer</b> - A specific implementation of the gradient descent
      algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Learning rate</b> - The “step size” for loss improvement during
      gradient descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Batch</b> - The set of examples used during training in a single
      iteration.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Epoch</b> - How many times this cycle should be run?</p>
    <p><b>Forward pass</b> - The computation of output values from input.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Backward pass (backpropagation)</b> - The calculation of internal
      variable adjustments according to the optimizer algorithm, starting from
      the output layer and working back through each layer to the input.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Verbose</b> - Argument controls how much output the method produces.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flattening</b> - The process of converting a 2d image into 1d vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Softmax</b> - A function that provides probabilities for each possible
      output class.
    </p>

    <p><b>xxxx</b> - xxxx</p>

    <h2>Convolutional neural network</h2>
    <p>
      CNNs: Convolutional neural network. That is, a network which has at least
      one convolutional layer. A typical CNN also includes other types of
      layers, such as pooling layers and dense layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Convolution</b> - The process of applying a kernel (filter) to an
      image.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Kernel / filter</b> - A matrix which is smaller than the input, used to
      transform the input into chunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Padding</b> - Adding pixels of some value, usually 0, around the input
      image.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pooling</b> - The process of reducing the size of an image through
      downsampling.There are several types of pooling layers. For example,
      average pooling converts many values into a single value by taking the
      average. However, maxpooling is the most common.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Maxpooling</b> - A pooling process in which many values are converted
      into a single value by taking the maximum value from among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Stride</b> - the number of pixels to slide the kernel (filter) across
      the image.
    </p>
    <p><b>Downsampling</b> - The act of reducing the size of an image.</p>
