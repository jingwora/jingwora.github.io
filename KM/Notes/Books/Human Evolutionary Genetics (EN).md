### AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS
---

#### 1.1 WHAT IS HUMAN EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS?
- Evolutionary genetics is founded on the principle that the genetic record of life is contained in the [[genome]]s of living species and it reveals evolutionary processes and relationships all the way back to the last universal common ancestor of all species.
- Two developments
  - The public availability of human and nonhuman genome sequences
  - Technology as the tools to analyze huge datasets
- Different layers of the past are accessible through the analysis of genetic diversity.
- The past is the source of the present

- By identifying segments of DNA that are more similar between the two species than could be expected by chance, we can identify regions whose evolution has been constrained by the need to perform a specific function. Some of these regions are genes.

###### Understanding evolutionary history is essential to understanding human biology today. 
- The interaction of humans and their surroundings comes to the fore, as does an understanding of human adaptability in the face of huge variability in inhabited environments.

###### Understanding evolutionary history shapes our expectations about the future. 
- An evolutionary perspective on human genetic variation also allows us to make predictions, both about biological research, and about the future of our species.
- Phenotypic traits of humans are controlled by a combination of inherited and environmental factors, and stochastic developmental and molecular processes.

#### 1.3 COMPLEMENTARY RECORDS OF THE HUMAN PAST
- Different types of evidence available
- The **historical** record comprises written texts: 4,000 years ago

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/time-past-record.png)

- Spoken languages retain evidence of their origins over thousands of years.
- Many of these languages can be traced to a number of ancestral languages known as proto-languages.


![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/distribution-language-family.png)

- The **archaeological** record consists of physical objects that have been shaped by human contact. These include not only tools, ornaments, and pottery, but also soils, waste deposits, houses, and landscapes. The earliest recognizable stone tools date from about 2.5 million years ago (MYA). 
- The **paleontological** record comprises the fossilized remains of living organisms or their traces, such as preserved footprints. The earliest microfossils are suggested to date from 3500 MYA.


###### Understanding chronology allows comparison of evidence from different scientific approaches.
- To cross-referencing between multiple records is to relate them all chronologically, by dating events and processes visible in the different records. 

###### It is important to synthesize different records of the past. 
- To paint a fuller picture of the past we often seek to combine information from multiple records into a single synthesis. 

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/history-synthesis.png)


###### None of the different records represents an unbiased picture of the past
- We do not have a time machine, and therefore must rely upon evidence that has survived to the present. This survival is selective

#### 1.4 WHAT CAN WE KNOW ABOUT THE PAST?
- We can ask how genetically diverse humans are?
- What proportion of genes?
- How genetically similar two humans are?
- Which genetic changes make us human?
- The processes of recombination and independent chromosomal assortment divide the genome into segments that have independent genealogical histories

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/population-growth.png)

- The curves representing potential ancestors of a single individual and world population size intersect within the past 900 years. 
- Before this time, everyone in the world was potentially an ancestor of every living person. 

#### 1.5 THE ETHICS OF STUDYING HUMAN POPULATIONS

- Researchers take responsibility for the accurate popularization and public dissemination of this research, including active opposition to misinterpretation
- Irrespective of the source of funding, public concerns about the implications of our work must be addressed. 
- Recent public anxiety has been focused on issues of ownership, commercialization, and privacy. 
- Steps must be actively taken to ensure both that such misuse does not occur

## SECTION 1

### CHAPTER 2
### ORGANIZATION AND INHERITANCE OF THE HUMAN GENOME
---

#### 2.1 THE BIG PICTURE: AN OVERVIEW OF THE HUMAN GENOME
- In February 2001, a milestone was reached in the attempt to sequence the entire human genome. 
  - discovering sequence variation that can be analyzed in evolutionary and disease studies.
  - comparative analysis of other animal genomes
  - understanding of the structure and function of chromosomes
  
- Humans, like almost all animals, are diploid—that is, we have two copies of the genome in each of our somatic cells, the cells that make up our tissues. The human haploid genome (that is, a single copy) is composed of about 3.2 billion nucleotides (nt), the fundamental building blocks of DNA within which information is encoded.

- Protein-coding genes comprise a mere 2% of the genome; some of the remaining 98% is essential for producing RNA molecules that are never used as intermediates in protein production, but for gene regulation and for the function of chromosomes; but much of it may have no specific function.
- ENCODE (the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements; genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/) set out to find all the functional elements in the human genome.
- Gene predictions are currently at 23,532, only some 3000 greater than the nematode worm.

###### the human genome sequence
- The reference sequence is not derived from the DNA of one individual, but many. This means that it is an artificial composite, and does not reflect the true sequence of any real genome.
- The result is not perfect:
  - The reference sequence contains sequencing errors, though remarkably rarely—about 1 per 100,000 bases.
  - It contains gaps, though only ~250. Some of these will be closed by teams of people known as finishers.
- The reference sequence is continually being improved. Genomic coordinates generally differ between versions.
- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/guide/all/

###### chromosomes
- The diploid nuclear genome is divided into 46 chromosomes, made up of 23 pairs
- Females carrying two X chromosomes, and males one X and one Y chromosome.
- Male-specificity of the Y means that it is passed down only from father to son.

#### 2.2 STRUCTURE OF DNA
- All organisms, with the exception of a few kinds of viruses, use deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as their genetic material.
- Two central biological roles:
  1. The instructions for making the components of a cell
  2. Set of instructions to be passed to the daughter cells when a cell divides

- DNA is a polymer, and its monomeric subunits are called nucleotides. 
- There are four varieties of nucleotide, which differ in portions known as bases. 
- The bases are adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, abbreviated as A, G, C, and T, and it is the order or sequence of these parts of each nucleotide that carries the genetic information.

Double-stranded helical structure of DNA
![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/DNA-structure.png)

#### 2.3 GENES, TRANSCRIPTION, AND TRANSLATION
- Transcription - RNA polymerase makes an intermediate RNA molecule, known as messenger RNA (mRNA) from the DNA template.
- Translation - mRNA is then used as a template to convert the code of nucleotides into the code of amino acids, to produce a protein.

- Genes are made up of introns and exons, and include elements to initiate and regulate transcription. 
- Transcription produces a pre-mRNA that contains both the exons and the introns. A complex process known as splicing then removes the introns, before mature mRNA can be translated into protein. 

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/protein-coding-gene.png)

- Genes vary greatly in size and complexity
- Human mRNAs are eventually degraded with a median half-life of ~10 hours.

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/human-gene-property.png)

###### The genetic code allows nucleotide sequences to be translated into amino acid sequences

- Codon is a set of three adjacent nucleotides specifies one of the amino acids, or alternatively represents an instruction to halt translation (stop codon)

- Since there are 64 possible triplet codons, there is more than enough capacity in the genetic code to specify the 20 amino acids and a stop signal. The code is therefore redundant.

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/genetic-code.png)

###### Gene expression is highly regulated in time and space

Proteome: a subset of these genes is expressed in any one cell type at any one time.

Gene ontology  is a catalog of each gene product’s cellular component of expression, molecular function, and the biological process in which it is involved.

#### 2.4 NONCODING DNA
- noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) which function in their own right, including molecules with key functions in translation
- The functions of the great majority of these ncRNAs are unknown, and a proportion may represent transcriptional noise. However, evidence is accumulating that many ncRNAs play important roles in the control of chromosome dynamics, splicing, translational inhibition, and mRNA destruction, and our protein-centric view of gene expression and regulation is undergoing a change.

- DNA sequences change through time by mutation, but functionally important sequences change more slowly because changes are more likely to have deleterious effects.

###### Some DNA sequences in the genome are repeated in multiple copies
- Copy-number variation exists, so that some genes are single-copy in some genomes, but multi-copy in others.
- At the deepest level, some human genes show sequence similarities to others that reflect ancient duplications of an entire ancestral genome that occurred early in the evolution of the vertebrate lineage, several hundred million years ago.

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/genome-repeat.png)

#### 2.5 HUMAN CHROMOSOMES AND THE HUMAN KARYOTYPE
- The linear nature of DNA means that large genomes correspond to extremely long molecules.
- If it were a single DNA duplex and stretched out, it would be about 1 m long.
- The DNA molecule is first coiled round nucleosomes.

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/chromosome-DNA.png)

###### The human genome is divided into 46 chromosomes

- The nuclear genetic material of the somatic cells of normal human individuals is divided into 46 separate molecules—the chromosomes. (23 pairs)


![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/chromosome-DNA-2.png)

- The last two chromosomes are known as the sex chromosomes, because they differ between the sexes. 
- Females have two copies of the X chromosome, which, at ~155 Mb, is about the same size as chromosome 7. 
- Males have one X chromosome, but in addition they have one Y chromosome which is one of the smallest (~60 Mb) of all chromosomes.

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/chromosome-DNA-3.png)

G-banded chromosome
- The numbers of the dark and light bands are given to the left. 
- The telomeres are given the suffix “ter” (for “terminus”), and the centromere “cen“.
- Arrows to the right indicate the conventional armspecific directions of proximal (toward the centromere) and distal (toward the telomere).

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/chromosome-features.png)

###### Size, centromere position, and staining methods allow chromosomes to be distinguished
- Without the use of staining methods, differences between chromosomes that are visible through a microscope are their lengths, and the position of the centromere (seen as a constriction in most cases), which allow them to be divided into groups.
- 850 or more G-bands to be identified in a human karyogram


#### 2.6 MITOSIS, MEIOSIS, AND THE INHERITANCE OF THE GENOME
- There are two kinds of cell division:
 - Mitosis, the process seen in somatic tissues, each daughter cell contains the same genetic material as the parental cell.
 - Meiosis, however, is needed to produce a gamete (egg or sperm), which contains only half the diploid complement of genetic material (that is, is haploid).
- Mitosis has great importance in disease, since errors in mitotic divisions can contribute to cancer development.

- A gamete (egg or sperm; also known as a germ cell) is haploid; it contains only one copy of the genome, as opposed to the usual two copies in our somatic, diploid cells.
- Following this, however, the cells enter meiosis, a cell division process. 

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/cell-division-process.png)

#### 2.7 RECOMBINATION—THE GREAT RESHUFFLER
- A key tool in human genetics is the ==pedigree==: a collection of related individuals which allows us to observe how segments of DNA are inherited by children from their parents. 
- Sequence variants (sometimes called ==markers==) that lie on different chromosomes are independently inherited, and are said to be unlinked. However, two variants on the same chromosome, particularly ones that lie close together, may often be co-inherited within pedigrees; they are said to be linked.

- Two variants on the same chromosome, particularly ones that lie close together, may often be co-inherited within pedigrees; they are said to be **linked**.
- The recognition of such recombination events allows us to determine the order of genetic variants along a DNA molecule, and the counting of recombination events allows us to estimate the ==genetic distance== between variants; this is ==genetic mapping==.

- The frequency of recombination events varies between the sexes, because the production of eggs involves more recombination events than the production of sperm. Males have roughly 50 recombination events per meiosis, whereas females experience about 80, so the genetic map of females is expanded on average about 1.65-fold with respect to that of males.

- Some regions of the genome at least, events are concentrated in small (1–2-kb) segments of DNA known as **recombination hotspots**.

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/genetic-physical-compared.png)

#### 2.8 NONRECOMBINING SEGMENTS OF THE GENOME

- The great majority of the human genome is inherited from both parents, and undergoes reshuffling each generation through recombination. However, there are two segments of our DNA that are atypical, being inherited from one parent only, and escaping recombination.

- Inheritance of recombining and nonrecombining segments of the genome.
![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/inheritance-of-recombining.png)

###### The male-specific Y chromosome escapes crossing over for most of its length
- More than 90% of its length—a region known as the ==nonrecombining portion== of the Y (sometimes NRPY, or NRY), and sometimes the male-specific region of the Y (MSY).  Since it has no homolog with which to recombine, we expect the Y chromosome to avoid recombination.

###### Maternally inherited mtDNA escapes from recombination
- The other constitutively nonrecombining region of our genetic material is mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), a circular double-stranded DNA molecule about 16.5  kb in size. 

###### The unusual features of the X chromosome
- It is inherited twice as frequently from females as from males
- To balance the doses of X-chromosomal genes, one of the two X chromosomes in the somatic tissues of a female is largely transcriptionally silenced by ==X-inactivation==.
- The haploid nature of the X chromosome in males exposes them to increased risk of **X-linked** diseases, because in females the second copy can mask the effect of mutation.

- [[Mitochondria]] originated as endosymbiotic bacteria, taken up into proto-eukaryotic cells about 1.5 billion years ago, and providing energy generation in return for a safe environment.
- This ==prokaryotic== past has left its traces in the many remarkable features of mtDNA that resemble those of modern bacterial genomes.
- The number of mitochondria in a cell varies with cell type: those requiring a lot of energy, such as nerve and muscle cells, contain thousands of mitochondria.

### CHAPTER 3
### HUMAN GENOME VARIATION
---

#### 3.1 GENETIC VARIATION AND THE PHENOTYPE

- All humans are different from each other, and much of this difference has a genetic basis: differences in ==phenotype== caused by differences in ==genotype==. (with the rare exceptions carried by identical twins).
- The vast majority of the many differences between human genome copies have little or no phenotypic effect.
- ==Neutral alleles== are thought not to affect the evolutionary fitness of someone who carries them, and hence their frequency is not directly affected by natural selection. 
- OMIM (An Online Catalog of Human Genes and Genetic Disorders)
- https://www.omim.org/

###### Some DNA sequence variation causes Mendelian genetic disease
- Alleles that have a phenotypic consequence when only one copy is mutant can be recognized by the inheritance of a disorder from affected parent to affected child and are referred to as ==dominant==. 

- Many disease alleles, including those associated with CF, must be present in both copies of the gene for the disease to be expressed, and these are referred to as ==recessive==—mutation in one copy can be masked by the presence of a normal, wild-type allele on the other homologous chromosome.
- The mutant alleles of a patient manifesting a recessive disorder need not be identical at the DNA sequence level, but need only have similar effects on the function of the gene. When the two alleles are identical, the patient is ==homozygous==; when they are different, the patient is ==heterozygous==.
- Most mutant alleles in recessive disorders result in either severe reduction or absence of gene product from that allele, or production of an abnormal, nonfunctional product.

- The parents of a CF patient are phenotypically normal heterozygous ==carriers==, who each carry one mutant and one normal allele.

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/dominant-recessive-x-linked.png)

- ==Haplosufficiency== —  Fore carriers, half as much gene product as normal is being produced, but this is sufficient for normal or near-normal function.
- ==Haploinsufficiency== — Fore carriers, half as much product as normal is produced, but this half-dosage is not enough to ensure normal function.

- ==gain-of-function== — Dominance can also result from overproduction of protein from a mutant allele, or expression in an inappropriate place or time.

- Disease-causing alleles on the X chromosome can behave differently in males and females, because males have only one X, while females have two.
- An ==X-linked== recessive mutant allele will manifest in males (who are hemizygous), but not in females, who are heterozygous carriers. 
- Autosomal dominant and X-linked disorders are over-represented in disease databases, because they are easier to ascertain than autosomal recessive disorders.


###### The relationship between genotype and phenotype is usually complex

- That the path from genotype to phenotype is rarely simple.
- The roles of genetic and nongenetic factors in generating the phenotype

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/gene-phenotype.png)

- ==Monogenic== (also known as simple, or Mendelian) disorders show relatively simple patterns of inheritance in familie.
- ==Modifier genes== can influence phenotype.

###### Mutations are diverse and have different rates and mechanisms
- Our practice is to use ==polymorphism== (including SNP) to indicate ≥1% allele frequency, “variant” for any less frequent difference between genome copies, and ==mutation== to refer to a ==de novo== change.

#### 3.2 SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS (SNPS) IN THE NUCLEAR GENOME

- A mutation is any change (==insertion==, ==deletion==, ==duplication==, and ==inversion==) in DNA sequence, and covers a very broad spectrum of events with different rates and different molecular mechanisms.

- Scale of mutation

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/scale-of-mutation.png)

###### Base substitutions can occur through base misincorporation during DNA replication
- Through, DNA replication machinery has a double-checking function, occasional incorporation of the incorrect base does occur.
- Replication errors occur with a frequency of only about 10⁹–10¹¹ per nucleotide per replication event.

###### Base substitutions can be caused by chemical and physical mutagens
- DNA damage can be caused by chemical mutagens.
- Physical agents can also damage DNA. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a low-energy form of electromagnetic radiation that can induce chemical linking between adjacent thymidine nucleotides.
- Chemical and physical mutagens are important contributors to many cancers, but their effects on germ-line mutation can be very different from their somatic effects.

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/physical-chemical-mutagen.png)

###### Sophisticated DNA repair processes can fix much genome damage

- Elaborate mechanisms have evolved to detect and repair DNA damage. 
- The mutations that pass to the next generation are therefore the outcome of two processes—primary damage and failures of secondary repair. 
- In homologous recombination (HR), the undamaged sister chromatid acts as template. This ensures accurate repair, but because it relies on the presence of the sister chromatid, is dependent on the stage of the cell cycle at which damage occurs. 
- Cell-cycle progression is tightly coordinated with DNA repair and cell survival or death through a network of genome surveillance pathways.

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/DNA-repair.png)

###### The rate of base substitution can be estimated indirectly or directly

- For neutral mutations, the rate of mutation is expected to be equal to the evolutionary rate of change.
- Transitions are almost three times more frequent than transversions, despite the fact that for a given base there are two possible transversions to only one transition.

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/mutation-rate.png)

###### Because of their low mutation rate, SNPs usually show identity by descent
- Even though the base-substitutional mutation rate is low the current population size  is so large that the recurrence or reversion of any SNP in some individual(s) is expected to occur each generation. 

- The low mutation rate means that this class of mutation generally shows ==identity by descent==, rather than ==identity by state==.

- The allele resembling the great ape allele is known as the ==ancestral state== of the SNP (coded as 0), and the allele that differs is the ==derived state== (coded as 1).

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/SNP-determination.png)

###### The CpG dinucleotide is a hotspot for mutation

- The rate of base substitutions is not uniform throughout the genome. In particular, where a C nucleotide is followed by a G (denoted a CpG dinucleotide), mutation rate is elevated by more than tenfold. This is because of a chemical modification that occurs at most CpGs.

- Base substitutions and indels can affect the functions of genes
- In the open reading frame (ORF) itself, base substitutions can  have a wide range of possible outcomes, from no effect to a total abolition of  protein production. 

- Substitutions that do not alter an amino acid are known as silent-site, or synonymous substitutions, and are often assumed to be selectively neutral.
- Base substitutions which lead to a change of amino acid are termed nonsynonymous, or missense mutations.
- Change one amino acid for another that has different chemical properties;  such nonconservative substitutions are more likely to be deleterious than  are conservative changes. 

- A mutation changing  an amino acid codon into a termination codon is termed a nonsense or stop mutation, and is likely to be deleterious unless very close to the natural termination codon. Analysis of the 1000 Genomes Project data reveals  ~10,000 nonsynonymous and ~30 nonsense SNPs per genome.

- Multinucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs), where two or more adjacent base  pairs are altered compared with the reference sequence.

- A small indel within an ORF is more likely to be deleterious than a base substitution. Because the genetic code is based on triplets, any indel of a multiple of  three base pairs will lead to an insertion or deletion of amino acid(s).

- Whole-genome resequencing provides an unbiased picture of SNP diversity.

- SNPs discovered through many different methods are described by numbers  prefixed with the letters rs, for RefSNP, and are deposited in the database  dbSNP (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/). 

- Minor allele frequency (MAF), the frequency  at which the less common allele is found within a given population.

- We  expect to find one SNP about every 1250 bp. 

###### 3.3 SEQUENCE VARIATION IN MITOCHONDRIAL DNA

- Early comparisons of human and other primate DNAs indicated that the base-substitutional mutation rate in mtDNA is about 10 times higher than the average  rate in nuclear DNA.
