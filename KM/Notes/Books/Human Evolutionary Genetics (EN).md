## AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS

#### 1.1 WHAT IS HUMAN EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS?
- Evolutionary genetics is founded on the principle that the genetic record of life is contained in the [[genome]]s of living species and it reveals evolutionary processes and relationships all the way back to the last universal common ancestor of all species.
- Two developments
  - The public availability of human and nonhuman genome sequences
  - Technology as the tools to analyze huge datasets
- Different layers of the past are accessible through the analysis of genetic diversity.
- The past is the source of the present

- Time line of important developments in the field of human evolutionary genetics.

A phylogenetic tree relates different branches of modern species, showing that they are all equally derived from their common ancestors in terms of time.

- By identifying segments of DNA that are more similar between the two species than could be expected by chance, we can identify regions whose evolution has been constrained by the need to perform a specific function. Some of these regions are genes.

- Understanding evolutionary history is essential to understanding human biology today. Why is the present like it is?

- Understanding evolutionary history shapes our expectations about the future. An evolutionary perspective on human genetic variation also allows us to make predictions, both about biological research, and about the future of our species.
- Phenotypic traits of humans are controlled by a combination of inherited and environmental factors, and stochastic developmental and molecular processes.

COMPLEMENTARY RECORDS OF THE HUMAN PAST
- Different types of evidence available
- The **historical** record comprises written texts: 4,000 years ago

- Spoken languages retain evidence of their origins over thousands of years.
- Many of these languages can be traced to a number of ancestral languages known as proto-languages.

- The **archaeological** record consists of physical objects that have been shaped by human contact. These include not only tools, ornaments, and pottery, but also soils, waste deposits, houses, and landscapes. The earliest recognizable stone tools date from about 2.5 million years ago (MYA). 
- The **paleontological** record comprises the fossilized remains of living organisms or their traces, such as preserved footprints. The earliest microfossils are suggested to date from 3500 MYA.


- Understanding chronology allows comparison of evidence from different scientific approaches
