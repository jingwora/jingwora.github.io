### AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS
---

#### 1.1 WHAT IS HUMAN EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS?
- Evolutionary genetics is founded on the principle that the genetic record of life is contained in the [[genome]]s of living species and it reveals evolutionary processes and relationships all the way back to the last universal common ancestor of all species.
- Two developments
  - The public availability of human and nonhuman genome sequences
  - Technology as the tools to analyze huge datasets
- Different layers of the past are accessible through the analysis of genetic diversity.
- The past is the source of the present

A phylogenetic tree relates different branches of modern species, showing that they are all equally derived from their common ancestors in terms of time.

- By identifying segments of DNA that are more similar between the two species than could be expected by chance, we can identify regions whose evolution has been constrained by the need to perform a specific function. Some of these regions are genes.

###### Understanding evolutionary history is essential to understanding human biology today. 
- The interaction of humans and their surroundings comes to the fore, as does an understanding of human adaptability in the face of huge variability in inhabited environments.

###### Understanding evolutionary history shapes our expectations about the future. 
- An evolutionary perspective on human genetic variation also allows us to make predictions, both about biological research, and about the future of our species.
- Phenotypic traits of humans are controlled by a combination of inherited and environmental factors, and stochastic developmental and molecular processes.

#### 1.3 COMPLEMENTARY RECORDS OF THE HUMAN PAST
- Different types of evidence available
- The **historical** record comprises written texts: 4,000 years ago

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/time-past-record.png)

- Spoken languages retain evidence of their origins over thousands of years.
- Many of these languages can be traced to a number of ancestral languages known as proto-languages.


![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/distribution-language-family.png)

- The **archaeological** record consists of physical objects that have been shaped by human contact. These include not only tools, ornaments, and pottery, but also soils, waste deposits, houses, and landscapes. The earliest recognizable stone tools date from about 2.5 million years ago (MYA). 
- The **paleontological** record comprises the fossilized remains of living organisms or their traces, such as preserved footprints. The earliest microfossils are suggested to date from 3500 MYA.


###### Understanding chronology allows comparison of evidence from different scientific approaches.
- To cross-referencing between multiple records is to relate them all chronologically, by dating events and processes visible in the different records. 

###### It is important to synthesize different records of the past. 
- To paint a fuller picture of the past we often seek to combine information from multiple records into a single synthesis.

###### None of the different records represents an unbiased picture of the past
- We do not have a time machine, and therefore must rely upon evidence that has survived to the present. This survival is selective

#### 1.4 WHAT CAN WE KNOW ABOUT THE PAST?
- We can ask how genetically diverse humans are?
- What proportion of genes?
- How genetically similar two humans are?
- Which genetic changes make us human?
- The processes of recombination and independent chromosomal assortment divide the genome into segments that have independent genealogical histories

- The curves representing potential ancestors of a single individual and world population size intersect within the past 900 years. 
- Before this time, everyone in the world was potentially an ancestor of every living person. 

#### 1.5 THE ETHICS OF STUDYING HUMAN POPULATIONS

- Researchers take responsibility for the accurate popularization and public dissemination of this research, including active opposition to misinterpretation
- Irrespective of the source of funding, public concerns about the implications of our work must be addressed. 
- Recent public anxiety has been focused on issues of ownership, commercialization, and privacy. 
- Steps must be actively taken to ensure both that such misuse does not occur

### CHAPTER 2
### ORGANIZATION AND INHERITANCE OF THE HUMAN GENOME
---

#### 2.1 THE BIG PICTURE: AN OVERVIEW OF THE HUMAN GENOME
- In February 2001, a milestone was reached in the attempt to sequence the entire human genome. 
  - discovering sequence variation that can be analyzed in evolutionary and disease studies.
  - comparative analysis of other animal genomes
  - understanding of the structure and function of chromosomes
  
- Humans, like almost all animals, are diploid—that is, we have two copies of the genome in each of our somatic cells, the cells that make up our tissues. The human haploid genome (that is, a single copy) is composed of about 3.2 billion nucleotides (nt), the fundamental building blocks of DNA within which information is encoded.

- Protein-coding genes comprise a mere 2% of the genome; some of the remaining 98% is essential for producing RNA molecules that are never used as intermediates in protein production, but for gene regulation and for the function of chromosomes; but much of it may have no specific function.
- ENCODE (the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements; genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/) set out to find all the functional elements in the human genome.
- Gene predictions are currently at 23,532, only some 3000 greater than the nematode worm.

###### the human genome sequence
- The reference sequence is not derived from the DNA of one individual, but many. This means that it is an artificial composite, and does not reflect the true sequence of any real genome.
- The result is not perfect:
  - The reference sequence contains sequencing errors, though remarkably rarely—about 1 per 100,000 bases.
  - It contains gaps, though only ~250. Some of these will be closed by teams of people known as finishers.
- The reference sequence is continually being improved. Genomic coordinates generally differ between versions.

###### chromosomes
- The diploid nuclear genome is divided into 46 chromosomes, made up of 23 pairs
- Females carrying two X chromosomes, and males one X and one Y chromosome.
- Male-specificity of the Y means that it is passed down only from father to son.

#### 2.2 STRUCTURE OF DNA
- All organisms, with the exception of a few kinds of viruses, use deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as their genetic material.
- Two central biological roles:
  1. The instructions for making the components of a cell
  2. Set of instructions to be passed to the daughter cells when a cell divides

- DNA is a polymer, and its monomeric subunits are called nucleotides. 
- There are four varieties of nucleotide, which differ in portions known as bases. 
- The bases are adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, abbreviated as A, G, C, and T, and it is the order or sequence of these parts of each nucleotide that carries the genetic information.

#### 2.3 GENES, TRANSCRIPTION, AND TRANSLATION
- Transcription - RNA polymerase makes an intermediate RNA molecule, known as messenger RNA (mRNA) from the DNA template.
- Translation - mRNA is then used as a template to convert the code of nucleotides into the code of amino acids, to produce a protein.

- Genes are made up of introns and exons, and include elements to initiate and regulate transcription. 
- Transcription produces a pre-mRNA that contains both the exons and the introns. A complex process known as splicing then removes the introns, before mature mRNA can be translated into protein.

- Genes vary greatly in size and complexity
- Human mRNAs are eventually degraded with a median half-life of ~10 hours.

![image](../Attachments/Books/Human-Evolutionary-Genetics/human-gene-property.png)

- The genetic code allows nucleotide sequences to be translated into amino acid sequences

- Codon is a set of three adjacent nucleotides specifies one of the amino acids, or alternatively represents an instruction to halt translation (stop codon)

- Since there are 64 possible triplet codons, there is more than enough capacity in the genetic code to specify the 20 amino acids and a stop signal. The code is therefore redundant.
