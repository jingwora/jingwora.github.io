## Preface
In the early 1990s, biology students take some sort of Algorithms 101 and computer science students take Genetics 101 and Bioinformatics 101. This is an introductory textbook on bioinformatics algorithms and the computational ideas that have driven them through the last twenty years.
The very first bioinformatics textbooks were Waterman, 1995 (108), which contains excellent coverage of DNA statistics and Gusfield, 1997 (44) which includes an encyclopedia of string algorithms.
