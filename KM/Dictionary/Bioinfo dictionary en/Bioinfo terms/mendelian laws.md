>Laws of Inheritance
>1. **Law of Dominance**: one of the factors for a pair of inherited traits will be dominant and the other recessive unless both factors are recessive.
>2. **The Law of Segregation**: during the formation of the reproductive cells (gametes), pairs of hereditary factors (genes) for a specific trait separate; so that offspring receive one factor from each parent.
>3. **Law of independent assortment**:  the alleles of two (or more) different genes get sorted into gametes independently of one another..
